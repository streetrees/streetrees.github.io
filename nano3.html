Gary was the night security guard at the Kent municipal train yard. At 9 pm he arrived in his truck, parked behind the grey squat station building 
and clocked in at the back door. He entered his passcode (significance? ), the metal door clicked open and Gary entered the dim breakroom, 
taking notice of the white plastic clock hung slightly crooked on the West (what direction?) wall (why take notice?). 
He entered the main room, a few tables formed in rows facing another large plastic clock, it's white face marred by dust and 
scratches, the second hand ticking leisurely. Papers and thick grey computers were spread over the tables, Gary noticed a few pages 
from one desk had fallen onto the carpet, grey and green with stain and age. 
Bill was collecting his things into his bag as Gary came in, he looked up and smiled distractedly. 

Hey, hows it going tonight?

I'm good man, I'm good. Gary was far from good, his head was erupting in a headache, and he couldn't help but be annoyed that Bill 
had interrupted his thoughts. Bill had no idea, but Gary had spent the entire drive to the station preparing for the 
discussion he would have with his wife tomorrow. 

Bill had his bag slung over his shoulder but stood awhile longer, smiling strangely at Gary. Could he tell he was distracted? 

Yeah, enjoy, I mean it's supposed to be such a slow night. We only have the one mechanic coming in tonight, right? 

Yeah, I guess so, I haven't even had a chance to check the schedule yet. 

Bill sensed some aggression in Garys' reply and tried to read his emotion. Gary wasn't usually too talkative but they'd 
shared a number of smoke breaks and the guy always seemed agreeable. Closed off, but never too aggressive. 

The wind picked up and slammed the shutters against the four small rectangular windows at the front of the room. The men could 
here the air rush through the ceiling vent, sounding a dull, hollow tone. 

Be alert out there tonight, Bill said as he turned away. He'd had a strange feeling all day but he wasn't about to try and 
convey that to Gary, the guy seemed pissed as it was, no reason to freak him out too. 

Gary watched Bill walk back to the breakroom and exit out the backdoor, he didn't respond. 

The plastic wall clock read 9:10, Gary had to start his rounds but first he went back into the break room to start brewing some 
coffee. The coffee maker sat on a sticky washed-out purple counter surrounded by packages of spilling paper cups and creamer 
packets. The breakroom wasn't even large enough for a table, just a wooden chair kicked over by the door. Gary had already filled the 
machine with water and was adding the filter when he noticed that the back door had been left open. Must have been Bill, he thought.  

After starting the coffee, Gary went over to his supervisors desk and logged in to the computer. He opened the program that controlled the stations speaker 
system and flicked on the amplifier tower to his right, opening the bottom desk drawer he scanned through the CDs, he put on 
a band he didn't mind much, music crackled through the station and drowned away the wind in the trees outside. Finally, 
a distraction from his thoughts.  

Returning to the breakroom, the coffee maker light had flashed on. Gary poured his thermos full and stepped again through the 
back door he had closed just a few minutes before. When he released the handle the door swang back and clicked into place, the keypad
beeped to confirm that it was locked. 

Gary wasn't really paying attention to the yard like he usually did, he noticed other things like the tree branches swaying. He 
didn't even check to make sure the few silver security cameras mounted around the station
were working. He didn't really look to see if any cars were 
parked in the weedy asphalt patches around the building. He just listened to the lonely voice that could still be 
heard coming from the main 
station room, a female voice, crooked and waivering as she sang about midnight, the moon, or something like that. 
Gary stood at the edge of the tracks and looked down, there were a few trains parked for the night but most of the 
tracks were clear, he'd forgotten to check the schedule but it didn't matter, no trains came in on Sunday night. 

There was a tropical feeling to the wind, Gary took a sip of coffee and looked the other way at the sun setting down the tracks. 
a haze of yellow glow just setting. 

He felt something strange, although he couldn't place it. The air in the yard seemed stale, even with the wind blowing. He couldn't 
help but think about something breaking open, he thought about the lock on the door, why hadn't it shut itself when Bill left? 

He walked on to the edge of the yard, he could no longer here even the faintest sound from the speakers. It was just the wailing 
of the wind now. 

Traveling through the mountain pass at night, trying to make it back to Cordelane. He thought about her grabing his 
shoulder, as the car slid and fishtailed over and over. Snow covered the road and the windshield. She looked straight 
ahead, her mouth was frozen, her hand gripping his jacket as he drove. 

Then he thought about a different time, the sand whipping up in dust devils in the beach grass. He remembered her going out 
that afternoon to visit the sundrie shop on the boardwalk, he stayed behind to get the fire started. When she returned she held a 
blue glass shell. I bought it for you. They put it in the silverware drawer before they left, with the marbles and 
beach glass and broken shells. The cabin smelled like smoke, the wallpaper was torn from the walls in large swaths, the 
rooms were always cold. 

Back in the main station room, Gary began to look through the papers piled haphazardly around the desks. They detailed the 
arriving and departing, the train malfunctions throughout the day, the various memos various condutors had sent out, all of mostly 
no interest to him. The clock on the wall said it was now 10:30.

Gary wandered back to the breakroom and examined the 
backdoor, he knew what he was looking for, but he was still surprised when he found it. 
A torn piece of paper was folded in quarters and taped to the metal hinging mechanism at the top of the door. The paper 
preventing the door from closing completely. Gary scraped off the paper with his nail and unfolded the paper like he was 
looking for a clue. Of course it was blank. 





 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ideas: 
- flooding, the river expands, inexplicable 
- there's a crack that forms in the wall, it grows as gary watches, each time he turns back 
- a visitor, think, the man who visited me with the cigarette, perhaps a drifter? 
- the mechanic! this could be a strange drifter type character, he brings the machine in and it breaks, perhaps 
killing him? Gary knew that something would happen but now that it has.. 
- his gf coming back? 
- who is entering? did someone come in when the door was originally ajar? 

the key is: what is gary escaping? what is he dreading the next day, yet needs to make it to? 

the story is meant to capture the feeling of knowing something will happen, continuing to move towards it, the inexplicable 
coincidence of our life, suddenly, things are in line, and you only followed your path, but you didn't know about the path 
somehow, but you did also. 

Gary is aware that something is happening to him tonight, he's excited for the strangeness that will befall him, he is 
ready for his life to change.
