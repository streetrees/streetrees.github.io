Do you understand cableworld? My old house, you could say. 
<br><br>
I took home the cables and they began crawling from the walls, or really I placed them in a pile by the door. Do you understand fog, I asked, I beaconed, 
<br><br>
I came home and threw my new cables in a pile by the door, my grandmother was in the next room and came in to see what the noise was, this was when we lived 
together, in a small pink house in an old neighborhood, and piled near the door in a plastic bag were my cables, in the dark corner of the white painted walls, 
which smelled like lilies in summer, and my grandmother bent at the hip and looked down at the crumpled bag in the corner, did she understand? Did I understand? 
<br><br>
Her nails were always long and acrylic, they pinched the bag and looked inside, it was late August then, I wasn't really living with my grandmother, I was really 
living in cable world. 
<bR><br>
I can't say exactly when I moved to cableworld, perhaps it was today, when I started writing about it.
