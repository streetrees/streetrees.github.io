<i>Ulysses/Emperor Angelfish/the Unconcious</i>
<br><br>
I cried all day yesterday, which was actually lovely, it was like being in a play, where I go about my normal day but soft little tears 
run down my cheeks at opportune moments, it started on the train to my stats class, writing in my notebook about camping with my mother: 
<bR><br>
    <i>I wake in the trailer in the woods, to the cries of the insects, I left to find you sitting in the plastic chair in the meadow, I knelt at your 
        feet and looked up at you in the sunshine, the only god in life is mom, when will we find each other again in the grass? 
    </i>
<bR><bR>
but then it was on to my bayesian models! 
priors, posteriors, a priori, slopes, sigma bar, actually side bar; I haven't talked much about my stats class but it has captured my 
artistic imagination, I've started writing with a bayesian framework, i.e. what can you predict will happen if you do the same process thousands of 
times, what can you know from the past? But moving back to my tears, things picked up on the train to my german class, 
<br><br>
re: me, standing at the platform and thinking about the tattoo I've been considering, tropical fish, strange I know, I was thinking it was the connection to the 90s, 
this blog, the old aquarium with plastic fish I had as a kid, I start looking at various tropical fish 
online and at the sight of the <i>Emperor Angelfish</i> I am transported back to the same camping place 
(the rugged pines of the North Cascades) where my grandmother helped me write my first story, there were two trailers up there, our families 
and my grandmother's (hereby: mom-mom), and I'd go over to mom-mom's trailer in the mornings to work on my story, we took a little plastic 
fish and cut slits in the pages of our book so the fish could slip through them, to visit the sand, the seaweed, moving through the book itself.. 
<br><br>
I start to cry, overwhelmed by the power of the unconscious, the metaphor, the marks left by living, and I'm serenely letting the tears fall down my face when 
the man across from me leans over, 
<br><br>
<i>I was doing the same thing three days ago, crying on the train..I don't know what's going on in your head but we are with you, </i>
<br><br>
I'm shocked by the kindness and humanness of this (from a German!) but I also can't tell him about my grandma's stroke, so I nod and think about moving, but I'm 
practicing putting myself out on the table, and letting things be flawed and true, so I just go back to crying quietly and looking out the window, and 
we sit silently until we both get off at Friedrichstrasse, and he asks if I have a boyfriend and I decline, but am flattered that my show of train emotion 
was so beautiful, and he wishes me the best with pure love, 
<br><br>
I have to take the surprise test that I missed last week in my german class, and I tear up in between my teacher calling on me to fill in the <i>
    der dem die dieser diesem ihr ihm ihn etc etc etc </i> but it doesn't bother me, I love to cry, 
    <bR><br>
I feel everything building on my train back home, and it's pleasant, like waiting to orgasm, I decide I'm going to make it to the meadow next to my apartment 
before I full break down, but I climax on the sidewalk instead, the final piece falling into place as I put my hand over my mouth and sob, 
<br><br>
<i>
    where was the fish going? as it slipped through the pages? what was it looking for? looking under the seaweed and beneath the sand? the final page 
    I drew with my grandma, where the plastic fish comes to the end, and meets it's twin, it's mother, the fish was searching for his mother, 
</i>
<br><br>
I go to the park and cry in the grass under the clouds, things are so perfect sometimes, it doesn't matter if I'm held or not held, if my mother is 
away or here, both are true, both happen at once, 
<br><br>
At night, I dream that I'm in a dark movie theater, the screen so wide and bright that it hurts to look, and there are two beds, water beds, my hands 
sink down as I crawl up the bed, I crawl towards the feet and legs of my family, my parents, my uncle, I'm searching for k but they've gone to the other 
bed, they make tea and prepare to watch the movie, I wish they hadn't left, but I stay where I am, the theater is a wide and empty blackness, 
<br><br>
I wake, and write to you, now I will go to work, and see you soon,

When I was 16 I lived for a month with a host family in Bavaria, 
one morning I found a small pond in the forest; all mud and dark branches, 
a sign was posted in front 
showing the long, spread body of an eel. I wondered about the eels swimming at the bottom of the black water, I thought of wading into the pond,
half-hoping to feel the eels against my skin, but I left before going in.      
<br><br>
I remember my host father stuck his head out the upstairs window and waved goodbye to me in the 
driveway, his smiling face leaning out of the top of the little house reminded me of a cuckoo clock, and I had a vision of this same goodbye playing out year after year, 
as he aged and I aged but always returned at some point, to be sent off in the same way,   
<bR><br>
Premonitions work like this sometimes, that you know a moment is important but you're not sure why, or maybe it was just Nadine's expression when I said that I 
was excited to see her parents, that made the news make sense somehow, 
<bR><br>
On certain nights in spring, eels leave the water and move over land, they slip in black masses over the ground and find new pools, it's rare to see the eels 
moving through the forest like this, because it's always at night, and often in the rain,   
<bR><bR>
It was my grandmother's 93rd birthday last week, I kept getting busy in the evenings and promising myself I'd call the next day, five days later my dad texted me 
she'd had a stroke in the night and had developed aphasia, the paths to reach her words had been erased, and she could no longer find the words to speak, 
<br><br>
Eventually, the eels reach salt water and swim to a gyre off the coast of Mexico called the Sargasso Sea, 
there, they dive so deep that no sensors can find them, and no one knows what happens then, but the eels resurface months later and are found again in the brackish 
water off the coasts of Europe, where they enter the rivers, and move back to the land,   
<bR><br>
I went back to Bavaria this last weekend, I visited the pond but the sign with the eel was gone, only the mud and the black water 
was left, Did it look different now? Could I feel if the water was full or empty? 
I never called my grandmother and now she can't speak, time changes what you can't see, the eels I never saw have left, what would we have talked about?  
My grandmother's words overflowed the banks, your father passed away in March, I came back to Germany, the eels slip over land while we cannot see, leaving the pond to look the same 
in the morning, we sense only the skin and beneath, time is working, in the night, her words had already passed to me.
