To edge becoming a man, because that will make it someday sweeter. 
<br><br>
My body looks like a pool of tears, no it doesn't really, it looks like a woman's body. 
<br><br>
Were I to fuck you like a man, you might stop leaving. Were I to hold you like a man, I might stop crying. 
<br><br>
Writing is not really like opening the flood gates because flood gates open by command, and if you were in love with me it might actually make things harder. 
<br><bR>
Various prototypes such as pagers before cell phones: yes, it doesn't make sense, but we often have to make do with what we have. 
<br><br>
This old thing? I'm holding up the nightingale. 
<br><br>
At the end of my perfect day my dad comes to pick me up, otherwise I have to decide when it ends. 
<br><br>
If I wasn't in the room with you and you thought my name conciously enough perhaps planning to end it with Biden or S. Thompson could you conjure 
a new body for me in your head? This body would exist only for you to see (of course I wouldn't know anything about it) but perhaps 
you might replace me with this new body as your memories 
of us lapped at the shore leaving ripples in the stone over time, but of course that would be completely up to you. 
<br><br>
Right now if you want to see me you have to meet me in an imaginary world, most especially if you come to sleep with me. 
<br><br>
All I ask if that you remember to close the sliding glass door on your way out because I actually rely very much on the feeling of 
running into it.

<i>my first honest poem</i>

I'm selfmy and I'm in love with you,

<i>Another Dream</i>
<br><br>
I've been sick, but it's been nice. I don't need to leave my room if I don't want, and it makes canceling things easier. I took a nap this afternoon and 
was at the edge of a lake, I paddled across in a boat with my mom and put my phone in a multi-colored canvas bag. On the other side of the lake the 
person I'm seeing (it's going very poorly) had arrived with his other girlfriend from back home. They got in the boat but soon he got bored and went 
back to his room as it got dark, my mom headed home too. The girlfriend was average-looking and I hated her at first but she stayed with me at the edge of the 
lake, 'do you want to make strawberry daiquiris?' she asked and smiled. We went to the kitchen of the boathouse and collected a red concentrate like 
hummingbird food. 'I'm still on my tolerance break' I said, she smiled and sipped her daiquiri. I kissed her that night on the boat and I was happy that 
we were alone and that the person I'm seeing never came to see us again.   
<br><br>
I've been very sad. It's been nice. I've liked being sick and sad this weekend, as though there is nothing else to do. I was so upset that I couldn't 
write anything. I didn't really like my blog (it felt stupid) and I missed writing to you. Then I went to the Organic Store down the street from me to 
try and buy lavender, mugwort, and rose petals to smoke but I didn't find any of those. So I just went home as it started to rain. But right before I 
left the store I had the saddest thought, a thought so sad that I started to cry at the very threshold of the Organic Store. This thought was so dastardly 
upsetting that it broke through all the stagnant water and when I got home I could cry and cry. I'll tell you about the thought if you want, but be warned 
it's very sad. 
<br><br>
<i>
I have something that will make you cry. 
<br><br>
I stand at the edge of the ocean but the waves aren't lapping softly under the pull of the fresh moon, my body is not fertile valleys 
carved under sheets to be traced with your hand in the summer morning, 
<br><br>
When you left I wished I was a man, because men don't cry and I cry every day. You told me to take my books and I didn't, then I 
walked to this place called Springwater and kept walking thinking I might make it to the Burnside Bridge. I waited for you to text me 
that you were okay but you didn't, so I figured you were dead, laying alone in your apartment on the floor with my books mixed with 
your books. 
<br><br>
The way I stopped being a woman was funny. It happened in a zoom meeting. But when I realized I wasn't a woman I didn't become a man, everything just 
stopped making sense. 
<br><br>
When you left I wished I was a man, because I thought then you might have stayed. I thought you probably hated my vagina as much as I did, 
<br><br>
Release, I want to release this feeling. I would stand in the mirror and invert my skin so that it pulled taunt to my bones and then maybe it 
would look right, one day I told my nutitionist that looking at myself got easier when I pretended I wasn't a woman, I thought this was an obvious 
solution but Katie stopped and there was silence over the computer screen and then she just asked me if I wanted to use different pronouns. 
<br><br>
I remember you used to draw everything with top surgery scars, they were the next lines after eyes and a mouth, when I write about you I grit my 
teeth and it looks like I'm smirking but it's really because I'm uncomfortable, and it's funny because I got that from you. 
<br><br>
Crying feels good sometimes, when I was a kid I cried a lot, my parents put me alone in the room I shared with my brother and tied the door knob 
to the door across the hall so that I couldn't get out. Then I'd tear my room apart and we'd all laugh about that later, how I used to cry. 
<br><br>
My friend transitioned when we were 15, one night we watched Stand By Me in their room and I think we fell in love then, but I didn't know it 
until a long time later. Now when they go to work nobody even sees their old skin beneath the new, people just see a man and move on, 
<br><br>
I live in a bubble within the world, you view me and I look past myself, so to you there is a body but for me there is nothing below, only a hole and a 
drop where I can't see the bottom. Something is wrong but fixing it isn't so easy, because it starts with crying, and I often get stuck there.  
<br><br>
I think if I were a man nobody would ever leave. Because men don't cry because they have no reason to. And everything would make sense, and the hole would 
dissappear and you'd just see me instead of all the things I should have but don't.

<i>Recent Dreams</i>
<br><br>
My nuclear family was escaping some sort of BBQ/family reunion, it could also have been Berlin itself. But I remember sitting on the handlebars 
of the bike as my mom peddled me up the hill, I felt light, calm, it was getting dark and my mom noticed a white van motionless at the top of the 
hill, as though about to pull out onto the street. I turned around to her, she was starting to cry, 'there's the car,' 'what car?'
<br>I tell her, 'everything will be fine, it's just a car' I laugh  
<br>The car starts and drive away. 
<br><br>
My ex-roommate (J) is taking me up many steep steps within a white yurt. We reach the fourth floor and the stairway is now so steep that I 
balk - I know that soon the room will start spinning. I don't tell J and keep climbing. My vision is blurring and I don't know how to move my feet, 
I feel drunk suddenly, J is calling to me from far away, 'what's going on? do you need help getting down?' He tries to walk me down the steps, 
the carpet is beige and long like in my grandparent's house. My eyes are opening, I can clearly see the wall of my room, the large <i>MODERAT</i> poster
partially covered by a wave of yellow flowers that is my comforter taking up the bottom half of my vision, I'm trying to walk down the steps but now I only see my room, 
I realize that the yurt is a dream, but when I try to lift my body out of bed nothing happens. 
<br><br>
Soon, my parents come to help me, but they are more like the two old people in the hut in <i>the Princess Bride</i>, very strange looking, bald yet 
necks covered in silver hairs, and long ponytails. They stand at both edges of my bed and prepare medicines for me, 'I just want to leave the dream' I say. 
They nod, unconcerned. I try to remember what I'll do in the real world that day, I try to move my fingers to the giant wave of yellow, to just nudge it would 
be enough. 'I'm discombobulated' I think. I hear my phone buzz and I'm able to turn away from the poster and see my desk, the door, finally out, 
It's messages from M, 'you're discombobulated' 
he says. I look at my phone again, I'm know I'm really awake now, and the messages are gone.

It's been two weeks since I wrote on the blog. I actually changed this page to April and removed the March stuff on the first of April, but I didn't have time to 
write an entry so I didn't Git-Commit, and now you've all been left with the March page all this time.

I'm so tired. I don't want to see anyone. I want to be left to my own devices. I'm working on canceling plans, right now I'm not very good at it. I say, 
'lets try next week', then next week comes and I don't know what to do, because actually I want things to be like back when I lived in Lichtenberg 
and I'd walk across the street to the coffee shop and talk with the nice lady there about her kids, and she didn't know but she was the only person I would 
talk to that whole week, her and cashier who'd say 'Beleg dazu?' and maybe someone at a bank. But nobody who knew me.
<br><br>
All I wanted then was to have a friend, but now that I have friends I miss it. It felt like I was being scraped down the sidewalk every time something bad happened, 
and when I was in my room the time was like <i>an open window</i>, or just endless really. I was always trying my best to get through the time, 
the cut it back with my knife as it grew each second and became suffocating, but I'm sick of similes and I: have so much reality to 
report on. 
<br><br>
I went back home for 10 days, it was good. I'm starting a Bukowski book and I'm 1/3rd through a book about African dictatorships, I had my first day of 
class today and canceled two plans and laid the groundwork for canceling two more tomorrow. I missed one of my finals last week and had to go to a doctor's 
office to get a fake sick note. Today I couldn't register for the german class I wanted because my placement score was beginner german. I retook the placement 
test and got a high enough score but by that time the class was already full. I went to an applied statistics course this morning at a new campus, it was fine. 
I'm afraid of people, and I'm afraid of people leaving. I'm afraid of writing, and afraid of not writing. I got a tax extension.

Thanks, Will, it's not that I want to cut myself off completely (because I do) but I won't, it's that I want time to process things again, and write again. 
That's all, okay.
