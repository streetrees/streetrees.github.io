When I was 16 I lived for a month with a host family in Bavaria, 
one morning I found a small pond in the forest; all mud and dark branches, 
a sign was posted in front 
showing the long, spread body of an eel. I wondered about the eels swimming at the bottom of the black water, I thought of wading into the pond,
half-hoping to feel the eels against my skin, but I left before ever going in.      
<br><br>
I remember my host father stuck his head out the upstairs window and waved goodbye to me in the 
driveway, his smiling face leaning out of the top of the little house reminded me of a cuckoo clock, and I had a vision of this same goodbye playing out year after year, 
as he aged and I aged but always returned at some point, to be sent off in the same way,   
<bR><br>
Premonitions work like this sometimes, that you know a moment is important but you're not sure why, or maybe it was just Nadine's expression when I said that I 
was excited to see her parents, that made the news make sense somehow, 
<bR><br>
On certain nights in spring, eels leave the water and move over land, they slip in black masses over the ground and find new pools, it's rare to see the eels 
moving through the forest like this, because it's always at night, and often in the rain,   
<bR><bR>
It was my grandmother's 93rd birthday last week, I kept getting busy in the evenings and promising myself I'd call the next day, five days later my dad texted me 
she'd had a stroke in the night and had developed aphasia, the paths to reach her words had been erased, and she could no longer find the words to speak, 
<br><br>
Eventually, the eels reach salt water and swim to a gyre off the coast of Mexico called the Sargasso Sea, 
there, they dive so deep that no sensors can find them, and no one knows what happens then, but the eels resurface months later and are found again in the brackish 
water off the coasts of Europe, where they enter the rivers, and move back to the land,   
<bR><br>
I went back to Bavaria this last weekend, I visited the pond but the sign with the eel was gone, only the mud and the black water 
was left, Did it look different now? Could I feel if the water was full or empty? 
I never called my grandmother and now she can't speak, time changes what you can't see, the eels I never saw have left, what would we have talked about?  
My grandmother's words overflowed the banks, your father passed away in March, I came back to Germany, the eels slip over land while we cannot see, leaving the pond to look the same 
in the morning, we sense only the skin and beneath, time is working, in the night, her words had already passed to me.
