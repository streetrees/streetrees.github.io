<i>Visitor</i>
<br><br>
I walk through the door of a small wooden house outside of town, sitting at the edge of deep red marsh. The dream begins on the other 
side of the door, 
dark faces sit around tables and fall out of sight, it's my high school reunion. As I step through the door a boy appears at my side. 
He talks with me and stands with me as though he is my friend but we don't know each other, <i>he must like me,</i> I think, but he doesn't even know me. 
We walk through a garden and he asks what I do, I don't want 
to talk to him so I say nothing. <i>Oh, you won't even give me that? Where are you from at least?</i> 
<br><br>
<i>I live in Berlin.</i> I expect the conversation to be over, wait for him to say he lives in Covington but he doesn't,
<br><br>
<i>Oh, I bet you write poetry there.</i> He laughs, 
<br><br>
I say nothing, his face is lightened from nowhere, the way light works in dreams, like a spotlight. <i>How does he know that?</i> We find tables of people 
surrounding one face I barely know, I speak with them and they don't remember me, I see everyone's confusion, but the boy is at my side, he talks to the 
tables of people and laughs with me, we walk through the dark square outside, all roads curve out of sight, a large man is laughing and I say, 
<i>the old football coach</i>, the boy says, <i>I know</i>, he begins to look like S, then he is in a circle of his friends, they are all young, thin 
with curly hair, I wonder why the boy is here, he must have just started highschool, 
<br><br>
The boy is kidding me, <i>Why won't you tell me about yourself? With all of your biology and poetry you must have a lot to say.</i>
<br><br>
<i>I never told him those things,</i> I wonder how he knows to stay with me, how does he know that we'll be friends.
<br><br>
I begin to like talking with him, I like his laugh, 
<br><br>
I start to wonder, <i>maybe he'd like to go to that abandoned house with me, maybe we could go now in the dark and it would be beautiful and 
    romantic and maybe there is actually more romanic and intrigue and mystery here than in Berlin, maybe I didn't need to leave to find that, 
</i>
<br><br>
We are in the hallway outside the door, the boy is pulling huge cases of luggage, I realize it will not happen. I wonder why he won't stay with me, 
why he doesn't even ask for my name or my phone number. Standing against the inside of the door the boy looks suddenly older than me, his face is 
taunt and lines have appeared around his mouth and eyes, he looks down at me, 
<br><br>
I know I need to ask something, <i>What year are you anyway?</i> He smiles and says, <i>Oh, I don't remember.</i> I know that 
this will be our last time meeting so I say <i>I'll see you soon.</i> I don't understand how he can leave, why was he by my side all night if he 
won't stay? The man smiles, reading this thought, and walks out the door. It is 7 am now and almost everyone is gone, I go to my bag on the couch and wonder where my brother is, he appears with a purple bruise spread across his face like a 
birth mark, his skin is slick with water. <i>Eric and I were just out, we probably drank a bit too much, but you know, we were driving into town.. </i>
<br><br>
Eric appears next to him, a small man with huge glassy eyes like a fish, he looks past me at nothing. 
<br><br>
I wake up and make coffee in the kitchen, I'm wondering if I should tell my roommate 
about my dream and she tells me she had a strange night, found her Totoro she always sleeps with across the room when she woke up. I tell her about the boy I didn't know 
walking through my high school reunion with me, as I'm telling it I realize a third interpretation but I keep that to myself. When I finish she says, 
I think dreams are what we make of them, 
<br><br>
<i>Discussion Questions:</i>
<br><br>
1) <i>Fluidity of Love</i>
<br><br>
The boy doesn't know me, when we meet we are strangers, and yet he stays with me, why? I want this ease and certainty of connection, the boy needs no 
reason or preparation he simply knows that we work and we do. He trusts his intuition and stays with people that he likes, without needing to know why or how we 
work together, without needing to <i>go</i> anywhere, this is S of course, and my confusion when the boy leaves is the same one I feel when S leaves every week, 
I've been taught to expect some linearity or sense in relationships, that movements are signals, but they shouldn't be. In the dream, the boy moves within the 
bounds of each second and does not need his actions to tie together in some grand sense of self, he is here and then he leaves when it is time. 
<br><br>
2) <i>The Reunion in Dresden</i>
<br><br>
As I explained the role of the boy to R this morning I realized that I had been the boy this last winter, at K's side and moving table to table at their 
highschool reunion. This moves into recent interpretations of K, in which I'm realizing how little of that time I was concious of. I had to wait at my old U5 stop yesterday 
and felt a strange nauseating anxiety. Things that I fixated on while in my first-months disassociative haze 
are strange and tainted now, and I think K is like that. While I still think of them constantly, the thought of talking with them or things being in any way 
like this winter is terrifying. This was brought to the surface yesterday when I talked to some of the friends I met on New Year's, I wonder how different I seem 
to them now, I don't feel connected with that other person at all, as though they were a ghost that I don't recognize. 
<br><br>
3) <i>The Boy as My Past and Future Self</i>
<br><br>
Of course, the obvious interpretation is the boy as a visitation from my future self. I had hoped to start making my T appointment this morning before I got a 
headache, went back to sleep and had the dream. The boy is a guiding figure coming to pull me from my past (highschool reunion being a particularly on-the-nose 
representation) and kindly walk with me to the future, manhood/the open door. The value of this interpretation is the boy's patience. He does not need to rush me 
or even know why I'm speaking with the people I am, he stands at my side regardless and views my interactions with my past with curiosity and interest rather 
than forcing me to the door. He leaves because he knows that I can find the door on my own.

<i>I Too Will Take My Revenge On Seattle</i>
<br><br>
Everything looks like everything else, and that's why my fourth grade teacher said I was good with imagery. But luckily nothing is ever really 
like anything else, and that's what gives us things to say.   
<br><br>
I want to talk about angels but that seems silly now, since you would never think of it like that, so maybe I'll talk about the body of a 
whale being the forest where we grew up, and that being the long white arms which kept you safe that night when I was far away. 
<br><br>
I imagine you walked home steady, and simple, and it seems wrong to say anything about that night but talk about the silver hand of the angel 
who helped you home and up the crevices of the wall, soft as snow, never letting you feel afraid or confused and who remains now in the lines 
of your hand when you start to wonder what has changed. 
<br><br>
A woman opens her apartment window and I see her skin against the white pores of the wall behind her, the sun illuminates her looking down 
at her hands in the sink as she washes dishes high above me, I hear no sound, the sun is going down and it is summer, I am trying to write about angels 
and I can't, so I write about this woman in the window, and think that I would like to walk here again tomorrow.

<i>There's A Knocking At The Door That Won't Go, Excuse Me But Do I Know You?</i>
<br><br>
I turn off the Miles Davis and begin building. Below ground, I begin building. I wrote that once, so I can't write it again. 
<br><br>
There's lots of things to say, some about the <i>Riviera Apartments</i>, those apartments on the side of the highway I'm always on about,
set back in a teardrop cul-de-sac, row-like, low roofs and sharp doors with silver numbers that shone on sunny days as I drove past, sixteen and always busy,
 sun lighting up the tan sheet walls catching on the windows and staying insects between the panes, but the real show was at night, streetlights strung 
 down the lot, light beads, round bodies that created the Riviera Apartments in the wet darkness, each night like that, clicking heels on the 
 sidewalk, I rolled down my window to listen, but what did I know then? 
 <br><br>
I write about streetlights the way Bukowski writes about legs. When I drink, the next morning my piss smells sweet. 
<br><br>
What did I know then? Pretty girl I guess, she set up the camera to pose like a girl under an umbrella, maybe people will like me then, she 
thought, and the photo looked very serene, her umbrella tilted back and her looking up at what might have been rain.  
<br><br>
Can we be honest for a moment? I struggle to speak, I sit in the chair at my friend's house (I'm cat sitting) and begin to write fervently, 
the night before we are sitting around the table and the hands (aren't they really needles?) of the clock stop, 'your clock has stopped' Seowon 
points out, 'it always does that', an hour later Seowon screams as the hands run forward on their own, slipping down from twelve to three, I had 
said I thought about things like fractals, but I don't really know, I stopped talking somewhere back and was only listening, I said, 'that's really 
really scary' Seowon looked right at me and said 'Oh, you don't look real anymore', then I didn't. The room becomes plastic, words do things. 
<br><br>
I hope I don't know myself, like back then when I held up that silly umbrella. Because right now there's a lot of hatred, I really can't catch a break. 
'What's going on with me?' I think, and try and talk to you but just start wondering what the point of speaking is, like asking 'do you believe in God?' 
we now all agree it's all in our head, that's queer thinking, so I start to wonder about talking, if I'm never conveying information except for a recipe 
once in a while, or telling you to get away from me, but what else do I know? 
<br><br>
So what about the <i>Riviera Apartments</i>? I told you about them because I used to wonder if I would live there one day, twenty minutes from my parents house 
and off the highway outside Seattle, near grey-green parks with salmon in the streams, nobody ever got my obsession with the Riviera Apartments but my small hands 
on the steering wheel liked to pass by, only to wonder about 'someday', the place I am now, a strange house made up with words floor-to-ceiling, words I placed, they 
didn't come to me in color unnamed like back then, somewhere I started searching for words and then my vision became constructed, 'words do things', I scream at the 
clock which is no longer real, only placed near the window by my mind, superimposed on the dark vision of those old apartments, my vision includes all of it, maybe 
this is something you understand?

' why don't you love me? I have to ask, how can you not love me? and it comes to this, ruby red narcissism, why don't you love me? I ask myself again and 
    again as my blood moves through young veins, as my body opens for you as my skin collapses, as my scab pulls apart and you are inside, within me, only 
    in my memory, keep me in your skin and eat mine, let me be crazy, what is more human? my mouth is held wrong, askew, melted like a meadow, hold me like 
    she reached for the crocodile in the florida stream, don't you believe I can be something? you doubt me and I see it in your body language of your soft 
    touch like morning light on blinds, open me, yes, I'm embarassing, yes, I'm stupid, yes, why don't you love me? I ask over and over to the glass beads, 
    why don't you hold me, sweet beauty? snow holds the mountains and my lips hold my teeth, speak in my ear, love my walk, how do you approach me? like fingers 
    tapping, like my p's and b's (always mixed), why do we speak if not to tell ourselves in the sugar carriage of the words that we are alive? come down and I 
    see you behind me in the mirror, what if I drank every night, hated myself every night, spoke to myself every night? and you, an imagined version of course 
    because you could never be so beautiful, and neither could I. I guess, I wake, you put your hand on my belly and there is hate there, tell me it's alright, 
    because you did love me in the end. '
