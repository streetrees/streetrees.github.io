<i>Beach-Themed Bathroom</i>
<br><br>
It was Newport I think, we wanted to see the tide pools. I remember the photo of you with your legs open over the pool, your feet spanning it on the rocks. We took 
a photo of me walking on a log, my face turned away so you could only see my bleached hair, there was fog all around and my skirt was pink standing out from the dark sand. I wasn't eating normally then, I could hardly 
remember what I was doing. I wore someone else's skirt and didn't imagine that I could completely change, 
<br><br>
We went to a seafood restaurant in the town for dinner, it didn't feel right ordering nice food but you always paid, we drank and I wanted for us to be done eating 
so we could leave. Everything was exceedingly normal, the tables were lit from above and young people were talking around us. 
The beach house was already dark when we came back, our cat was crying and looking out the window, the world outside was completely blue. We 
watched a movie that was in the house, it was old and dumb and we laughed at it, I remember us both sitting on separate couches and also lying next to you. It should have 
been easy to sleep with you, 
<br><br>
Everything was orange in the street then, it was the COVID summer and I was alone in my house, our cat would wake me up scratching at my face in the morning, then I'd look 
out the window at a red sun, haze was thick over the road, it smelled like a campfire everywhere. I'm not sure what I did in the days, sometimes I drove to the 
grocery stores and delivered food, it wasn't out of kindness, I just needed to drive. Sometimes I thought about texting my ex, or 
M, I'd broken up with them both. 
<br><br>
You had wanted to see the tide pools, it was cloudy and cold because we went at the start of winter. At the time, we were still living together in the tiny house 
on Cesar Chavez. I was often mad at you, but it wasn't really your fault. We'd first lived in a motorhome together. When we 
finally drove our house down from Washington it wasn't finished, we'd only put siding on the outside walls and left the inside bare studs and bags of insulation. 
We started adding the walls and you created a bookshelf out of wood, you built it with thick shelves and a small section at the side worked as our ladder to get up 
to the loft. I imagine we slept there together every night, but since it's been five years now I barely remember. I got mad at you one evening about the bookshelf,
<br><br> <i> I 
hate it,</i> I said, the wood was too big because you used 2x4s, it was bulky and took up too much of the house. It wasn't sanded and the joints were just screwed together, 
<br><br>
<i>I thought you liked it?</i> you said, <i>I thought you wanted a bookshelf? I'll remake it, I'll take it apart tomorrow and redo it,</i>
<br><br>
<i>Thanks. I just know it can look better,</i> the light above us was a bare bulb, I hadn't found the hanging light yet, the one made of orange plastic. The bed 
had your sheets on it, they were cheap with small green flowers. I went up to the loft and ignored you for a while, you went on your computer down below. 
<br><br>
While I was driving I often thought about my ex girlfriend, or nothing, I'd turn on the radio and lose track of what street I was on, where the house was, 
how much time it had been. One night I realized my car was almost out of gas, I found a gas station and filled up the tank, I got a message from the person I was 
delivering for asking where I was, I didn't respond and just sat in the car, looking out at the lights beyond the parking lot, I thought vaguely about just going home. 
When I got to the apartment no one answered the bell. I messaged the customer and got no answer. I stood on the sidewalk for a while, just looking out at the dark street, 
thinking of nothing. Finally, at some unknown moment, I just set the bags down and drove away. Another time I went out to my car in the morning and found four gallons of milk in the back seat. The milk felt like a foreign object, 
I barely remembered where I'd been the day before. I looked back in my phone and found an angry message from a customer two days ago, I drove back to the house and put the milk on the porch, I left a note that said <i>sorry.</i>
<br><br>
We got in this fight about broccoli, we had gotten home from school and I started boiling a pot of water. <i>What about broccoli for dinner?</i>
I asked you, I got out a large head I'd just bought at the store. You sat in the chair across from me and started to raise your voice, <i>You can't just eat broccoli, 
    this isn't a meal.
</i>
<br><br>
<i>I can eat whatever I want, you can have something else but this is what I'm having,</i>
<br><br>
<i>I want to eat a real dinner, why don't you make something for both of us?</i>
<br><br>
<i>I don't control what you eat, what I eat is my decision, this is what I want.</i>
<br><br>
The water was boiling and I finished cutting up the head, I started putting the pieces in the water. You had a bottle of orange juice in your hand we'd just bought, 
you stood up and threw it at the wall, <i>stop doing this,</i> you couldn't control it anymore, my face twisted and I laughed and also became taunt, we both jumped 
at the sound, the juice never broke open, just rolled under the chair. Your face was red and you said <i>I'm sorry,</i> I started to cry and bent over the pot, 
I poured the broccoli into the sieve and put it onto a plate, it was a green mountain of fleshy stems, I sprinkled it with salt and cheese and looked at you, 
<i>this is all I need,</i> I said. You left to get dinner somewhere else, you brought the leftovers back for me. 
<br><br>
I can't explain why I still think of the bathroom in the rental beach house, maybe because of how lifeless it was. 
<br><br>
I was looking in the mirror. I looked deep into the glass and examined the curve of my cheeks and my eye sockets. 
I looked at my nose from the front and the sides. I moved up on the edge of the sink to check my neck and the tops of my shoulders. 
I wasn't done when you knocked. I looked at my new expression, watching my eyes move, and my mouth open slightly. I looked up at the starfish wall hanging. It looked real, although the net clinging to it was only decorative. 
On the sink were cream soaps that looked like shells, stacked in crumbling pile. There was a small blue window covered over with translucent film, 
so the outside world was made into vague shapes. I mostly ignored it. I mostly looked at the starfish. I let my eyes blur around the shape 
and its edges merged with the white wall. I could make it stand out even more this way, as though it were a real star burned black in my eye. 
<br><br>
You asked what I was doing. I couldn't answer. Large pits began appearing beneath my skin, like the seeds of a gum tree, I watched my skin morphing in the mirror and 
said nothing as I listened to you waiting outside the door. I turned on the water from the tap and tried to buy time. 
<br><br>
I thought of her on the bed, I thought of sitting on her stomach and looking down at her, I thought of her skin turning light blue in the light from the streetlights 
outside. Wind came in through the window we left open and moved the papers taped to her walls, I went into her kitchen for a glass of water and looked at the 
magnets on her fridge, they were all colorful from faraway places, she came behind me and touched my shoulder, 
<br><br>
I lay with you on the couch after the movie finished, it was normal that we should sleep together now, I don't remember if we did. I only remember coming out 
of the bathroom the next morning, finding a rash had spread over your face in the night, in the morning sunlight I looked away, the entire house was lit up now, 
sunlight warped in puddles on the ocean, the bathroom smelled like sandalwood, <i>It's time to check out,</i> you said, we left the charcoal log unlit in the fire, 
we drew the blinds, and drove home.
