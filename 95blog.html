I had my soil ecology test this morning, it went well I think. I've been busy this weekend studying for it, which has been nice in a way, of course, 
all of my usual thoughts were still there, always. It reminded me of how my 4th grade teacher told us to chew gum while we studied, i.e. no matter what I 
was reading or what time of day or how my I wrote, my thoughts floated around the background like some faint peppermint bullshit. 
<br><br>
It made me think of this E2 post I read forever ago about a man who meets a priest on a mountain top (etc) and is instructed that he'll be happy once 
he can have no thoughts for 30 minutes, so he practices every day first trying to go only 1 second without thinking and then 2 and then after an 
entire lifetime he can finally go 30 minutes and I think he's really happy or like dead or something at that point. This might actually not have come from E2, 
anyway the point is I'm practicing not thinking. 
<br><br>
When I was a kid and having the can't-sleep anxiety (I'm trying to write about this right now but I'm stalled because I'm realizing writing about 
my childhood bedroom is deeply lame) my mom got this book from the library to help me, I imagine it must have been about bad dreams or dealing with anxiety or 
something, but I remember her reading one section that advised that if you were thinking about something unpleasant just superimpose a nice thought 
in your mind, like thinking of ice cream. The book asked, <i>Can you visualize an ice cream cone in your mind? What color is it? How much detail can you 
add to the image? 
</i>
<br><br>
<i>Mom: You can try imagining something nice when you start to have thoughts you don't like, you control your thoughts.</i>
<br><br>
I think many would disagree with this idea that we control our thoughts, and find it actually quite condescending. In the E2 post the man didn't try and replace his 
thougths, he said that he tried to just let them pass, not becoming angry that he was thinking, but just letting them flow freely and pass by. Of course everyone 
fucking knows that, 
<br><br>
I'm trying to reroute myself slowly, trying not to be mad at the thoughts but also move away from them, not towards them. When I realize I'm there I'm 
trying to softly course correct, like slipping a paddle into the water. I can't tell if it's working yet, but I am feeling better and better.

After I read last night a few different people came up to me and told me that they really enjoyed my writing. This man from Brooklyn said he 
loved the way that I craft the story, someone else said they loved how quickly I accessed the emotion in my 
<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://everything2.com/title/claimed+cowboy?author_id=2200538#fliphone" target="_self">
 poem,
    </a> that one was k actually. But 
on the bus too, I walked with my friend Will and they told me them and their partner had come a few weeks ago, when I did the cockroach one, and that their partner 
always talks about it and asks if I've read again. My friend Sophia Rose said that she was inspired by my lucid dream piece last week, my friend Kat just 
said she loved everything. 
<br><br><i>
W: When do you usually write?
<br><br>
H: I write all the time. 
<br><br>
W: But like I usually write in the mornings, do you have a time that you..?
<br><br>
H: No. I've been writing compulsively at all hours of the day, I wake up and all I want to do is write, in the middle of the day I have to 
    structure my other work to keep myself from writing, I write at night, I write on the train, when I'm not writing I'm thinking of what I will write 
    soon. 
<br><br>
W: That's such a gift you know. </i>
<br><br>
I'm in an interesting place. I can feel I'm returned to a semblance of the <i>heidelberg period</i>, back when I was happy, unbothered by everything because all I wanted 
to do was work on my blog. Last night I sat on the bus going home and felt so content, I'd talked to my friends, I'd made new ones, I'd had fun and people liked 
my writing. When I got off the tram I ran home in my cowboy boots under the moon and the cold sky and smiled all by myself. 
<br><br>
I read my tarot cards this morning and listened to the sound of the cards as I shuffled, the pages of the book turning, it felt grounding and calm, 
sitting on my bed as the sun rose and I could watch the sky turn pink to blue. First I read k, of course I still think about them, as much as I don't want to 
admit it. I finally got a letter from them yesterday, this letter was finally vulnerable, I could feel their thin tendrils 
of honesty, which at last, gave my power back. They told me they knew the problem was unrequited love, that we simply don't work, and not because they 
can't access emotion or whatever bullshit they've been saying, but just because they don't love me, and that love doesn't make sense. 
<br><br>
I liked the letter, it was finally in line with how I've been seeing things (re: the pool of unrequited love) and I liked that they included a second letter 
they'd written later, saying they had been afraid to send it since they didn't want to come off too harsh, but that they wanted to talk about love more with me. It 
was the backdoor M had been warning me about, that k will always try and pull me back one more time. They're afraid of losing control of people, so 
they need me to say that I want to continue to talk with them. I thought it was funny they were worried about it being too harsh, as if I haven't already built my 
own self back from falling into a disassociative pit the last two months. I do feel incredibly strong now, since I found my way out of the <i>underworld</i>
basically on my own. 
<br><br>
My cards literally told me, <i>it's time to pack your bags and get moving, there's nothing left for you here, it's time to look to the horizon and 
    keep moving forward. </i> And then told me that again, and again. I believe them too, I've been thinking about the beauty of giving k unrequited love. 
    Not mine anymore, but theirs, because I think they're going to regret what happened. Their cards showed that they are about to enter a period of 
    rebirth and creativity, but reversed, and also involving the death card; I don't think they'll like it, but I'm hoping I can give them the beauty they've 
    given me, the pain and reflection and the growth that I feel now.

<b><i>Wolbachia</i></b>
<br><br>
It emerged slowly, doctors said it had been present since birth, probably passed from my mother, and suspended, waiting, within the follicles that pupate 
the ridges of my seminal tract, a small thing, a burrowed worm sleeping between the cytoplasm walls, until provoked by 
<i>an unknown mechanism</i>, maybe the necessity of time, maybe the chemicals which formed my wings,  <br>
what was one cell became two, 
<br>a pulsing colony began to spread it's arms through the funnels of my reproductive system, then moved to my lymphatic, whispering new instructions 
to the enzymes working in my brain, I was only 20. 
<br><br>
I woke one morning with a growth the size of a mango above my thigh, I lay in bed looking up at the ceiling and touched the new extension of my body, 
I was afraid. Doctors couldn't find the reason, but they cut into the growth and removed the colony, 
taking the stems but not the roots. What was only skin above my thigh was left a pink scar. The infection left my skin and hid within my eyes.    
<br><br>
I remember the day when you told me you didn't feel right. It took months for you to reveal the 
size of the growth, how much of you was now enclosed by the corral, all that had changed. I listened in your living room, there was nothing to be done.    
<br><br>
I took your hand at night and curled my body around yours, together we lay in <i>Wolbachia</i> soup, we gave a name to the intruder, and he became part of us.

I remembered last week that I'm a voyeur. I'd been playing my guitar in the evenings just sitting in my desk chair pointed at the curtains when I realized: 
I can just spy on my neighbors. 
<br><br>
My new apartment is wonderful, it's large block buildings arranged in small squares and courtyards, so I can see the entire wall of the neighboring building 
from my window, each row 2 or 3 apartments, many people leave their curtains open in the evening and I slowly play <i>Angeles</i> over and over as I watch 
my neighbors reading to their kid in the drawing room, or the old couple that loves to smoke together in the kitchen, or the men who live alone and cook 
rice.

Last night, the clouds had cleared and I could see Orions Belt drifting over the other roof, it was like a dream, the patchwork of still-yellow windows, 
the people moving and talking and smoking, me making my own music, my fingers sliding on the wrong strings in the dark and slowly correctly, rewiring the 
sound until it matched the stillness of the night outside. I keep my lights off so I can't be seen, and I think about how I can do this every night. Every night 
I can come to my window and feel something I've dreamed about since childhood, seeing into the windows, uninterrupted, alone. 
<br><br>
But do I want to be alone? Of course I thought of k last night too, that nobody was there to appreciate me being so beautiful and cultivating such a beautiful vibe 
in the studio. I have this need for validation when experiencing beautiful things, as if the feeling can't be as strong if it's only me there. I understand this in a 
way, because sharing something beautiful with someone else forms a bond. The question is then, can viewing beautiful things alone bond you to yourself? What does that 
even mean? 
<br><br>
I'm thinking specifically of the <i>street light</i> outside my house in Auburn, the one I used to go out to the porch to watch for hours. I didn't want my 
mom or my dad to understand the <i>street light</i> , and I definitely didn't want to try and explain my fascination with it to my friends at school. I've 
been thinking of going tagging alone, I want to get back in touch with this part of myself, the part that knows where the beautiful things are: night, trainyards,
broken windows, and just wants to see them because I love them, not because I need someone else to see that they are beautiful too. I wonder what that would feel like? 
To explore something beautiful that only I will ever see, I wonder when that idea got so far away from me?
