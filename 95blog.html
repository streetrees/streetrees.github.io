<i>Subject: update on my inner realm</i>
<br><br>
I read cards last night asking about my desire for sex. I ask myself often why I don't just go on Hinge again to try and find someone. I want to find a new k, 
someone that I want to explore sex with in my new way, now that I am actually thinking. I want to have sex while I'm present in my mind, not drunk, sex while I'm looking at 
the other person and anticipating them. K was the closest I've come to this, since I met them while I was learning to think. Sex with them feels open when I think back, 
since I wasn't myself anything could have happened. 
<br><br>
There's been very few times I've really wanted to have sex with someone. It comes up from power imbalances, I want to have sex with people who have extreme 
power over me, i.e. k at this moment. I want to try and create a safe version of this, i'm in Berlin, it's only BDSM, I'm jealous of people 
who go to sex parties and explore power play, tying, tension, because that's also why I came here. 
<br><br>
My solution was the Empress, my problem was the Magician. The Magician is about this 'action' I worry I'm not taking, <i>why don't I just try?</i> while the 
Empress is about what's below, my connection to sensuality in my world and within myself. I learned more about tension and desire this year than I ever had 
with a partner. 
<br><br>
At night, I lucid dream. I am in a medieval town with M. I immidiately try and eat, I want to eat as much as I can. Since my first lucid dream, they are always 
places where I try and eat, because here I am more fully within my fantasy.

    <b>No Victim</b>
    <br><br>
    He drove a white van with a dent in the driver's side door. A dent like a meteor crater. He was stopped in the intersection, mid-turn. 
    <br><br>
    A man unlike any I have ever met. A man who would block the intersection just to get my attention. A man who knew that I was important.  
    <br><br>
    He was whispering sweet things. He was telling me how much he loved me, in simple 
    fragrant words that soothed me as I stood on the sidewalk, waiting for the crossing light to change. He said I was the most beautiful person he 
    had ever seen, that I was wonderful, that I meant so much to everyone on this block. Then the passers-by looked to me and smiled too. 
    The man who was stopped in the white car behind him rolled down his window and waved. The woman looking out from the apartment across the way lifted her cup of tea. 
    I took in the soft encouragement and hardly even wanted the light to change as it slowly blinked, a red hand keeping me here a while longer, 
    asking me if I'd like to stay, and I did.  
    <br><br>
    The man raised his hand from the open window and motioned for me to come over. A shy, quiet motion, undesiring, unexpectant. His fingers still then 
    suddenly more, a movement of camaraderie, as though we shared a secret, as though we used to fight on the same side. 
    <br><br>
    The people who had been so eager to get home now stopped their cars. They rolled down their windows and looked out at us in the dusk, their eyes 
    reflecting just a thin strand of light from the gas station on the corner. They watched me protectively, like they were my parents. I couldn't see their 
    faces, but they saw everything. They understood what was happening.   
    <br><br>
    I stepped into the intersection. Watching the man as I walked up to his door, smiling coyly as I felt the power of being asked to be only myself. The city cradled me, soaked me in love then opened like the stamen of a flower to let me choose, I knew that I was safe, 
    and so I approached the window. 
    <br><br>
    The man's left hand dangled out, his fingers still now, yet full. He had jammed a black cylinder into his palm. I will never know why. 
    The metal had cut and soured his 
    skin, leaving its shape in permanent sores that still clutched the grip long after he had wanted to let go. 
    He looked afraid now, and I saw that he needed me. He looked at me like he was my grandfather, and with acceptance, he took something from the powder 
    at the bottom of the barrel.  
    <br><br>
    I touched the cold metal and he dropped the object into my palm. I stepped back and met his eyes. 
    In our look, I thanked him.  
    <br><br>
    The crossing light turned to a white figure. The onlookers quietly started their engines and the white van itself drifted off, out of the intersection 
    and far away, to a place I never visit. 
    <br><br>
