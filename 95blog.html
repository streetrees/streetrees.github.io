I came home to a large hole in our bedroom, a ladder led down into the floor and disappeared. 
<br><br>
<i>What is going on with you?</i> I ask, 
<br><br>
He doesn't respond right away, his glasses are up on his nose and he's looking at a book in his hands, his legs straight out on the bed, 
<br><br>
<i>I was just looking at something.</i>
<br><br>I don't ask what, <i>have you made some changes to the house?</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes. <br>
<br> I had to access the pipes. The water doesn't have enough pressure,</i>
<br><br>
<i>Ah-- and how was your day?</i>
<br><br>
His voice is very bright, he looks up, his eyes are clear green, the table lamp coats us both, <i>I was just at work, just the same as always,</i>
<br><br>
<i>I see,</i> he goes back to the page,
<br><br>
<i>and how is the research paper going?</i> I look out the window, at the cool blue setting outside, 
<br><br>
<i>I need to speak with you,</i> I have some 
compulsion against my judgement, I need to tell him, 
<br><br>
<i>I'm feeling distant from you,</i>
<br><br>
He is looking up again, this time blankly, <i>Why?</i>
<br><br>
He makes no move from the bed, I try putting my hand on the edge, still far from him, as though he can feel through the blanket, 
<br><br>
something is going on with me, 
have you seen it?
<br><br>
<i>I feel far away from you, and you don't seem to want closeness,</i> he looks inadvertently into the hole, 
<br><br>
<i>This is all tied to my mother, I suspect, you know she was overbearing, she followed me around the house, I guess I'm still trying to get away 
    somehow.
</i>
<br><br>
He keeps looking in the black circle, I feel around in my mouth, we had walked outside some night like this, looking up at the houses across the river, the 
lights in some windows showed plates, curtains, we pointed at them, 
<br><br>
<i>I'm sorry you're feeling trapped,</i> I said, <i>I want to let you be yourself, only you aren't showing yourself to me--</i>
<br><br>
<i>I am, you see me all the time,</i>
<br><br>
maybe I want to keep some parts to myself,
<br><br>
I think of your mother in the kitchen, her soft brown hair which looked like mine, it was feathery and you often called her an owl, you could also be poetic. 
Who would get to you first? I wondered, 
<br><br>
<i>I guess we just have to give it time,</i> you nodded and said something, then turned a page to show you had left. I wandered away to the kitchen. My 
hands on my face felt cold and unattached to my arms, the kettle didn't seem to be working, I couldn't understand whether the light meant on or off, 
when I went and laid down he continued to read late into the night, as I slept in a different body.

She sat on the couch and I across, a woman I know yet wanted intimately for her to ask, 
<br><br>
we had been all around at this point, the first night we had sat at a table in a plaza, sure, the others had still been around, 
the color of stones and neon signs unremarkable, even in Spain, or because of Spain, the woman and the man, parents of someone I also know, 
they created an egg of sorts, or another name, asking about Jeremy, I didn't know, frying the edges, they seemed to laugh, I couldn't quite grasp the 
meaning, why they left the center raw, 
<br><br>
thinking the to-and-fro of the people below might jog something, instead we went to the bike race and climbed the hillside amid juniper berries, I found 
the paths that had been matted by deer hooves, going far ahead I still waited for her to shout the question up to me, perhaps in the quiet evening 
alone in the tiled kitchen, a window might look out to orange streets and a square painting hang from above the stove top, the morning light then, 
as I turned to her making my coffee, 
<br><br>
she would at once, string together a long grass hill and ask about the lake I had once visited with my mother, although her words would be <i> how are your 
    parents,</i> she would, as we sat at another outdoor table, legs bumping against each other, stirring clean ice cubes she would enquire after my father, I would 
    then move towards a grey green room, perhaps parakeets still nest here, this far south, I turned the key in the wood door as though, where is she? A question 
    posed and forgotten, outside the remains of morning.

At my grandmother's house we would wake in the early morning. I remember it now because I am in Spain and the morning is like one I remember, cold and warm 
at the same time, people are already out and walking in skirts, although my grandmother's house was only cars going by the front window. My grandparents 
made us breakfast and waited for me to finish. The sky was still a soft color without the full sun, we often ate in silence. 
<br><br>
On some mornings, she took me to the park down the hill, in the center was a large metal ball rusted and painted like a sun with a face, he 
looked too human-like, with big human eyes and eyebrows. I grabbed the metal sides and swung around, the hills around were green and I could not see over them. 
<br><br>

The man and his girlfriend of 8 months took us to dinner, 
<br><br>
He liked to control the table, telling us he would choose the place, but once sitting down his girlfriend selected the food, <i>I'm a foodie</i> she said, 
<i>This place is quite good.</i> She had wide eyes sunk in her head, she was a banker she said with big nods, smiling across to her 
boyfriend. So the food came and it was many things I did not know cut and stacked together, an olive, a sardine, and a pepper skewer. I ate wrong, not all 
at once, the talk turns immidiately to violence, <i>the forfeit their rights when they use violence,</i> he says without room for argument, since we're the guests, 
me especially. His girlfriend is telling us she goes to the gym in her hour lunch, the mother, his friend, telling various stories of them as 
children, he had fallen while skiing and gotten a scar, she had gone after to stay in the Canary Islands. We have moved off the topic of violence, they instead 
talk about gluttony, glutton they tell us, <i>we were gluttons in Peru, we were tired of eating,</i> beneath my hands are a fork and a knife, across the city 
the remains of the food I've eaten is being wheeled around in garbage cans, perhaps going by the window now, reminds me, the man has a big face and a big lip, 
his hair is combed back, he holds her waist outside and they unite in a hurry to leave. I go to the single bathroom and look at my wide face in the mirror, I 
smile and look at my big teeth, the waitress is fixing the wine on the shelf, she doesn't look at me.

His father dug holes with a hole boring machine. His company sent him to cities in Europe and Africa, constructing giant blades to spin beneath the homes, in 
a single motion it cut the width of the subway tunnels. 
<br><br>
His mother was a telephone operator, she moved the wires in the switchboard, at night she went back to the farmhouse, <i>this was in Peoria</i>, she said.  
He came home from school and found the house empty, he took a red metal car from it's box and pushed it along 
the floor, dust came up where he moved, he made sounds to show the car was driving. He heard his mother come into the next room, he felt 
the cold breeze come from the open window and the smell of apples rotting in the garden, he lay on his bed until she left. 
<br><br>
Supper was prepared in the kitchen, the tablecloth shone under the incandescent light, his father smiled as he ate strips of pork and eggs, his mother showed 
her teeth when she grinned and looked at them all, his sisters sat together, their fingers grabbing at the edge of the table. 
<br><br>
<i>Kirk, what do you think of a boy who doesn't like to work?</i> He looked at his plate and said nothing. His father smiled around the table and spoke, 
<br><br>
<i>Don't be hard on him, Mary, I finished plenty in time.</i> 
<br><br>
When he went out to the garden he watched birds along the fence, he wondered what kind they were, his mother watched from the window, then went to the doorway, 
she shouted for him and he pretended not to hear, the birds flew from the noise, their wings brushed together in a soft hush. He walked farther down the road, but there 
were only crows in the path now, his mother came from behind him, she watched his arms hang at his sides and his body twist as he walked, 
<br><br>
There is a rumbling in the ground, he imagines his father's machine, pushing past the worms and caterpillars, he takes his red car to the edge of the trees and 
pushes it into the cold mud, he reaches far in and comes up empty, the car seems to drive on it's own, her voice comes from above his head, her skirt is getting 
wet at the bottom, <i>Why do you never do as I ask?</i> she grabs at the car half out of the water. Slowly, he forces it on beneath the streets.

<i>It's all state changes, moving out of Washington at some point,</i>
    <br><br>
    Why not put it on the news? 
    <br><br>
    The president wakes up from another dream, he writes in a notebook and meets with the president of Isreal, 
    <br><br>
    What do I know? They should have hired a material scientist. 
    <br><br>
    I put the mixture in the microwave and wait for it to boil, I watch it through the leaded glass. 
    <br><br>
    Outside somewhere they are swarming together, they decide when it's time, bubbles pour from the bottle and 
    <br><br>
    I send the wrong data, 
    <br><br>
    The president is on the phone with someone else, he tells the entire room about his dream, 
    <br><br>
    Does it count? When I put the wrong liquid in?
    <br><br>
    When it breaks and we hire a materials guy next time, 
    <br><br>
    I don't know about everything, I don't know how you felt, holding the gun in your hand and going to the house, holding 
    it out against your hip, mime the action, mime your hands and show, as though you would, 
    <br><br>
    I don't know the fear you felt, the blood in your heart and the suspicion coming in shadows beneath your skin while you 
    waited,
    <br><br>
    he tells me about his friend and we say he needs to be aware of his actions, he needs to open up, he needs to look around. 
    <br><br>
    A strain gauge would have helped, we look over the busted metal,
    <br><br>
    To predict every action is to finally be invisible, surely I would never touch the bedside again.

<i>Beach-Themed Bathroom</i>
<br><br>
It was Newport I think, we wanted to see the tide pools. I remember the photo of you with your legs open over the pool, your feet spanning it on the rocks. We took 
a photo of me walking on a log, my face turned away so you could only see my bleached hair, there was fog all around and my skirt was pink standing out from the dark sand. I wasn't eating normally then, I could hardly 
remember what I was doing. I wore someone else's skirt and didn't imagine that I could completely change, 
<br><br>
We went to a seafood restaurant in the town for dinner, it didn't feel right ordering nice food but you always paid, we drank and I wanted for us to be done eating 
so we could leave. Everything was exceedingly normal, the tables were lit from above and young people were talking around us. 
The beach house was already dark when we came back, our cat was crying and looking out the window, the world outside was completely blue. We 
watched a movie that was in the house, it was old and dumb and we laughed at it, I remember us both sitting on separate couches and also lying next to you. It should have 
been easy to sleep with you, 
<br><br>
Everything was orange in the street then, it was the COVID summer and I was alone in my house, our cat would wake me up scratching at my face in the morning, then I'd look 
out the window at a red sun, haze was thick over the road, it smelled like a campfire everywhere. I'm not sure what I did in the days, sometimes I drove to the 
grocery stores and delivered food, it wasn't out of kindness, I just needed to drive. Sometimes I thought about texting my ex, or 
M, I'd broken up with them both. 
<br><br>
You had wanted to see the tide pools, it was cloudy and cold because we went at the start of winter. At the time, we were still living together in the tiny house 
on Cesar Chavez. I was often mad at you, but it wasn't really your fault. We'd first lived in a motorhome together. When we 
finally drove our house down from Washington it wasn't finished, we'd only put siding on the outside walls and left the inside bare studs and bags of insulation. 
We started adding the walls and you created a bookshelf out of wood, you built it with thick shelves and a small section at the side worked as our ladder to get up 
to the loft. I imagine we slept there together every night, but since it's been five years now I barely remember. I got mad at you one evening about the bookshelf,
<br><br> <i> I 
hate it,</i> I said, the wood was too big because you used 2x4s, it was bulky and took up too much of the house. It wasn't sanded and the joints were just screwed together, 
<br><br>
<i>I thought you liked it?</i> you said, <i>I thought you wanted a bookshelf? I'll remake it, I'll take it apart tomorrow and redo it,</i>
<br><br>
<i>Thanks. I just know it can look better,</i> the light above us was a bare bulb, I hadn't found the hanging light yet, the one made of orange plastic. The bed 
had your sheets on it, they were cheap with small green flowers. I went up to the loft and ignored you for a while, you went on your computer down below. 
<br><br>
While I was driving I often thought about my ex girlfriend, or nothing, I'd turn on the radio and lose track of what street I was on, where the house was, 
how much time it had been. One night I realized my car was almost out of gas, I found a gas station and filled up the tank, I got a message from the person I was 
delivering for asking where I was, I didn't respond and just sat in the car, looking out at the lights beyond the parking lot, I thought vaguely about just going home. 
When I got to the apartment no one answered the bell. I messaged the customer and got no answer. I stood on the sidewalk for a while, just looking out at the dark street, 
thinking of nothing. Finally, at some unknown moment, I just set the bags down and drove away. Another time I went out to my car in the morning and found four gallons of milk in the back seat. The milk felt like a foreign object, 
I barely remembered where I'd been the day before. I looked back in my phone and found an angry message from a customer two days ago, I drove back to the house and put the milk on the porch, I left a note that said <i>sorry.</i>
<br><br>
We got in this fight about broccoli, we had gotten home from school and I started boiling a pot of water. <i>What about broccoli for dinner?</i>
I asked you, I got out a large head I'd just bought at the store. You sat in the chair across from me and started to raise your voice, <i>You can't just eat broccoli, 
    this isn't a meal.
</i>
<br><br>
<i>I can eat whatever I want, you can have something else but this is what I'm having,</i>
<br><br>
<i>I want to eat a real dinner, why don't you make something for both of us?</i>
<br><br>
<i>I don't control what you eat, what I eat is my decision, this is what I want.</i>
<br><br>
The water was boiling and I finished cutting up the head, I started putting the pieces in the water. You had a bottle of orange juice in your hand we'd just bought, 
you stood up and threw it at the wall, <i>stop doing this,</i> you couldn't control it anymore, my face twisted and I laughed and also became taunt, we both jumped 
at the sound, the juice never broke open, just rolled under the chair. Your face was red and you said <i>I'm sorry,</i> I started to cry and bent over the pot, 
I poured the broccoli into the sieve and put it onto a plate, it was a green mountain of fleshy stems, I sprinkled it with salt and cheese and looked at you, 
<i>this is all I need,</i> I said. You left to get dinner somewhere else, you brought the leftovers back for me. 
<br><br>
I can't explain why I still think of the bathroom in the rental beach house, maybe because of how lifeless it was. 
<br><br>
I was looking in the mirror. I looked deep into the glass and examined the curve of my cheeks and my eye sockets. 
I looked at my nose from the front and the sides. I moved up on the edge of the sink to check my neck and the tops of my shoulders. 
I wasn't done when you knocked. I looked at my new expression, watching my eyes move, and my mouth open slightly. I looked up at the starfish wall hanging. It looked real, although the net clinging to it was only decorative. 
On the sink were cream soaps that looked like shells, stacked in crumbling pile. There was a small blue window covered over with translucent film, 
so the outside world was made into vague shapes. I mostly ignored it. I mostly looked at the starfish. I let my eyes blur around the shape 
and its edges merged with the white wall. I could make it stand out even more this way, as though it were a real star burned black in my eye. 
<br><br>
You asked what I was doing. I couldn't answer. Large pits began appearing beneath my skin, like the seeds of a gum tree, I watched my skin morphing in the mirror and 
said nothing as I listened to you waiting outside the door. I turned on the water from the tap and tried to buy time. 
<br><br>
I thought of her on the bed, I thought of sitting on her stomach and looking down at her, I thought of her skin turning light blue in the light from the streetlights 
outside. Wind came in through the window we left open and moved the papers taped to her walls, I went into her kitchen for a glass of water and looked at the 
magnets on her fridge, they were all colorful from faraway places, she came behind me and touched my shoulder, 
<br><br>
I lay with you on the couch after the movie finished, it was normal that we should sleep together now, I don't remember if we did. I only remember coming out 
of the bathroom the next morning, finding a rash had spread over your face in the night, in the morning sunlight I looked away, the entire house was lit up now, 
sunlight warped in puddles on the ocean, the bathroom smelled like sandalwood, <i>It's time to check out,</i> you said, we left the charcoal log unlit in the fire, 
we drew the blinds, we drove home.
