My father's birthday today, and a month until I'm 25. I remember my mother looking at me through the bathroom mirror, pulling down her lips to show me her 
receding gums and the yellow stalks of her teeth. They looked normal to me. She says, <i>everything gets better until you're 25, then it's all downhill. </i>
<br><br>
My old friend reminds me on the phone that I'm losing sleep over an ameoba, <i>and they move slowly, plus it's cool to get your eye eaten</i>. I get to sleep sooner 
after that but it doesn't change the fact that bright lights and screens hurt my eyes now, and I get a strange pain, like pressure within the eye. Not to mention 
the tooth in my lower jaw that hurts when I eat now, the gum frantically brushed away, bringing it's pale yellow root to the surface. 
<br><br>
I try and tell myself It's Very Punk Rock to have strange maladies, but at night I am very sure now that I will die. I promise myself I'll masterbate 
every day now, and I think of getting back with my ex. Worst case, they're an asshole, but I already expected that, and what if I die before I love again?
<br><br>
I try thinking of my body like a building. I know from my building collapse YT videos that buildings can really take a lot, this is like the first leak, 
my roof flooding and the water seeping into a few rooms, weaking the ceiling slightly but mostly cosmetic, will be patched within the year and will leave 
only water stains, which I like the look of anyway. But you never fully know about the internal stucture, a missing bolt somewhere.
<br><br>
<i>Days</i>
<br><br>
In the field, lies an old farm house. Within the house, on the table, sits an egg, Gwendolyn's egg, bluegreen. In the morning, the bluegreen egg is 
taken from the straw and placed on the table, the sun rises from the mountains and warms the farmhouse and a sliver of the table, 
the egg is bluegreen, there are no people in the house. 
<br><br>
A tree out in the prairie looks strange. It is too big, a comb of branches that are too high and wide, the tree takes up the whole sky when I look that way. 
In the wind it takes the horizon too, turning it's branches and catching all the air, turning much more than the other trees, it is grey while they are green. 
<br><br>
There are other structures near the house. Metal tubes, spines and ribs, ivy covers many, you can see into some windows and there is a desk and a bookshelf, 
but outside it is cold and mostly made of metal, the sun sets every time I go there, and I watch it go down, leaving this place.

[<i>CW: This post is disturbing and unpleasant in many ways: gore, death of loved one, anxiety </i>]
<br><br>
<i>Where do I start and you end?</i>
<br><br>
I stand in the bathroom and look at my eye in the mirror. Red veins have emerged between the corner and my iris, and within the mass I swear I can 
see a perfect circle, outlined in red and glowing dull grey. Like another eye has fallen in. 
<br><br>
I dream that night that I'm going on a trip with my parents. Before we leave we go to my grandmother's house to say goodbye, but we can't find her. I search the rooms 
and the empty hallways until my parents say we'll find her later, and we drive away. Two weeks later we come back to the house, everything is like we left it, every room 
is empty. We search and call for her until I notice the sound of flies, circling near the ceiling, all trailing from one room.    
<br><br>
When I start to believe I'm going blind, what I see starts to change. White surfaces begin to look more black, I begin to see faint crosshatch, fuzziness, 
like TV static, surrounding me in white rooms, between myself and objects I see only a strange blurriness hanging in the center of the room, and the halo of lights, now lasting 
minutes, hours, burning the negative image of chairs, tables, into my retina, superimposing my room into the laboratory, everything pressed and darkening onto 
everything else. 
<br><br>
In the dream I follow the flies, to her bathroom, tucked behind her bed, through a small door we never checked, her arms and legs hang from the tub, 
 I close the door and tell my parents, <i>she was dead before we left</i>, my mom laughs, <i>so it didn't matter anyway</i>. 
<br><br>
At night, I watch the red curl and spread under the edge of my contact, thinking of what it will be like to be blind, that I'll have time to think then, 
can learn to write though speaking, that the dark is only another room, that it's good to always change, that I'll feel wind differently then, and pay more attention 
to voices. I imagine being left with only what I've seen, to recombine and imagine more, I try and feel good about that. 
<br><br>
But I worry about the clear blue iris, as the grey mass throbs and breathes in the mirror at night, slowly growing from the white tissue and soon to break the 
surface. The nice eyes, that look just like my mother's, <i>you have such beautiful eyes</i>, the strangest beauty, the only beauty that I couldn't control, 
but could lose, I see now, the risk of things that come easy, and never really felt like mine.   
<br><br>
I fall asleep and dream again, this time I cannot open my eyes, the lids heavy and sloping down, one after the other, I stand in the bathroom of my 
grandmother's house and watch halves of my vision go dark, I try and pull the lids open but my vision is slow and blurred, I hold the walls as I walk 
down the hallway. I realize that I know this feeling, and that it comes in dreams, so I close both eyes and move deeper, leaving the 
house and waking in my bed. 
<br><br>
I explain my symptoms to the eye doctor, <i>redness, light sensitivity, pain from contact lenses</i>, he prescibes me eye drops for seasonal allergies. 
When I go home I see that the red veins have faded, the circle barely visible now, back to hiding within the lens.
