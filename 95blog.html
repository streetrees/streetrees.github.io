I want to tell you about this winter, am I finally on the other side? Can I say something about it now?
<br><br>
To be insane in Berlin, I listened to the album I used to listen to then, alone on the subway, alone and always alone, 
<br><br>
What I remember is leaving your apartment and walking up the steps to Yorckstrasse, it was always cold, 
<br><br>
I force it, because I don't know if I can say anything about that yet, the person standing on the train platform so distant from me, 
the sun closing over the buildings, the ring bahn taking me around and around, I never knew where I was, every face looked like yours, or adjacent, 
or opposed, everything in relation to you, the center of my world your apartment, there was always snow on the ground and it felt like your touch, there 
was always ice on the road and you'd tell me not to slip, walking was hard without you,
<br><br>
The city didn't make sense to me, I was waking in a dream world, it was always cold, I walked the streets next to my apartment at night, there was an orange 
glow and the windows of the other buildings didn't seem to belong to anyone, I never spoke to anyone but you, 
<br><br>
Let's talk about Christmas, I've never had a Christmas, I was only born this February, before that there was only the Christmases my mom got drunk 
and drove us home, and fucking on your parent's couch, your mom turning to me during Home Alone 2 and telling me she has depression, maybe I was really in love with her? 
Throwing up in an alley outside your high school reunion, I wish I could have been hotter in front of the kids who bullied you,  
<br><br>
You hugged me once before I got on the ring bahn, because you knew that it would never take me home, <br><br> 
I hope you never touch me again.

The oldest lie I still believe about my body is that I have control over it, 
<br> <br>
I eat and my body is built, my body is built from decisions, my body is a bag of food, my body is a bag of time. 
<br>
When I stop eating my body takes itself apart from the inside, 
<br>
<br>Actually, the mirror creates my body, my body is a shell cobbled from what's around me, 
the thoughts I have, when I eat the food disappears within me and only my DNA is reflected in my skin, and the space taken up by my shoulders 
is filled with your own assumptions of my linearity, of how I spend my time, of what I've done. 
<br><br>
Bones are alive, what can you tell from bones? What can you tell from my body? There is no effect from something as simple as food, I wish there was, 
I come thinking of the simplicity of this, control and release in one, in the body, they are always the same action. 
<br><br>
It is the middle of the night and I can't sleep, it is dead summer and I feel like a child in my parent's house, with the fan turning in the night by 
the window, I am alone, like then, with a mind and a body that have changed but keep the memory, history is a body created by judgement, my body's history 
is made of judgement.

Maybe people are also like drugs. It's all stimulus, and I think we all know people are like drugs without even having to say it.

<i>Someone tells me they like me, they aren't you.

    Someone tells me they like the words I use, they aren't you. 
    <br>
    I sit alone, I want to be held by you and only you. 
    <br>
    I want to fall apart, I want to be in pieces.

There are two reactions to food, the first is bodily, my cells taking the food apart and incorperating it into me, taking the proteins to rebuild my DNA and the carbohydrates to move my muscles and the fat to lie beneath my skin, creating the shape of my body in space, and the shape which you see me. The person you see is a collection of the food I have eaten only transmutated through many systems, many ways of counting and carrying which continue to build me whether I ask to be built or not, were I to want these processes to stop I would need to stop the source, and let them begin to take the scaffolding apart instead.
<br><br>
There is a second reaction to food, the cultural and imaginary. I had my first lucid dream when I was in second grade, I was on a deserted island surrounded by fruits and I could taste the sweetness as though I was awake, so I ate as much as I could, the sweetness perfectly recreated in my mind, and in the dream my body grew and became fat but I knew that it was all imaginary, and when I woke up everything would be the same. My most memorable orgasms happen in dreams, the reaction building and climaxing and I know that it is imaginary, and actually when I wake up, nothing will have changed. Things are better imaginary, or in dreams, where there are no consequences. I eat and change my body and yet the next day you see me the same. But imagine if the dream were real, if I would eat in the real world and my cells and my body transform, and you would see my actions reflected in my body, and know what I had done.
<br><br>
Imagine if you were with me when I climaxed and saw it and remembered it, and saw me from a vantage point I can not control. Even masturbating is much worse than coming in a dream, because my body cannot change when I want, I cannot make myself any shape, and afterwards the real world changes.
<br><br>
I would rather suck on mints for sweetness, things that leave no trace towards you, and hide the release of eating in dreams where you cannot see it, the place where my body shifts and molds easily and there is no delayed, prolonged reaction, aging, as I take in what has happened, and show it all to you.
