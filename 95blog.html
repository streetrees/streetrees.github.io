Last night I turned out the light and laid on my side with my ear to the pillow. I heard a familiar beating from deep in the synthetic feathers, 
like the sound that came before I slept in my old house, I listened closely and tried to tell if it was frogs or insects, calling out near the water, the clicks of wings 
coming from a secret pond between the buildings. I turned to the window and fumbled 
with the handle, twisting it in the dark to let in the sound, then I realized the chirping was coming from beneath my hand, from the radiator.

This week at work I finished my audio book on the fall of the Roman Empire; I skipped through the part after it became Holy, but I liked the parts
with Caligula and Marcus Aurelius. I switched to a book called <i>Effective Editing</i>, it started with a congratulations <i>If you're reading this, 
    you've just finished the first draft of your novel! You should feel very proud of yourself. </i> 
<br><br>
I realized quickly that I knew almost nothing about writing. I had to learn 'show don't tell' in an email from my ex, tactfully trying to tell me 
not to use the word 'memory' in my piece more than 10 times. The book tells me the most important element of a story is the characters, 
<i>If someone asked you to tell them the plot of Hound of the Baskervilles, could you do it? Probably not. But if someone asks you to describe Sherlock Holmes, 
    you could immidiately picture the brilliant detective.</i> Actually, the only thing I remember about the Hound of the Baskervilles is the word 'moor'. But 
    if you ignore language, then sure, characters I guess. 
<br><br>
<i>It's important to identify what your character WANTS, then identify what your character NEEDS. In attempting to get what they want, your character will 
    change by instead receiving or realizing what they need. 
</i><br><br>
What does the person writing this blog want? 
<br><br>
On the train this morning I was sitting in the back with my head down listening to Metric, <br><br>
<i>I'm in the front row with a bottle <br>
Don't know what I can't decide <br>
I'm in the front row <br>
I'm a model <br>
Don't know what I can't describe </i>
<bR><br>
I see the ticket checker coming behind me and realize in that instant that my pass expired at the end of September. I have another one in my email inbox from my 
school but I hadn't bothered to actually set it up yet. The guy stands above me and sees my expired pass and starts speaking in German. I'm saying something like, 
<i>I really have it I swear, it's just in my inbox, I'm a student I swear,</i> he doesn't seem aggressive, just burnt out. He says more and waves for me to follow 
him off the train. There's something in his movements that signal to me that I can just run away, and when we get to the platform I just tell him I'm going. 
<br><Br>
<i>Ma'am, you need to please have respect for my job.</i> 
<br><br>
It's all half-hearted. I just turn and walk away, <i>I'm sorry, I'm leaving.</i>
<br><br>
Some things aren't real if you don't make them.
<br><Br>

<br><br>
There is something funny about me feeling sorry for myself all the time. I recently told my favorite co-worker about my blog, he was asking me how often I wrote, 
<i>I write all the time, I have this blog I keep up...</i> <br><br>
<i>Oh, I'd like to see some of your writing sometime. </i> <br><br>
I went into the bathroom and pulled up my blog on my phone, imagining my co-worker looking at it. It suddenly seemed so ridiculous, the repeated eyes, my sad 
poetry on the first page, I imagined them reading it aloud to their boyfriend as they laid in bed together, saying <i>yeah, this is really who I work with</i>. 
<br><br>
I see that this girl I know is getting published in <i>ROOM</i>, 'it's a story about a lesbian threesome at the end of the world' she writes. 
<br><br>
Fuck. 
<br><br>
She's working on this story about a woman who fucks a tractor, but first publishes a piece about how she's working on it. It's cool, like how she views sex and love, 
and all these different perspectives she's gotten about object sexuality. I message her instantly that I'm sorry I never sent her my favorite object sexuality doc 
but here it is, and did you consider this ending, etc. etc. etc. 
<br><Br>
I asked her about sex when we met, <i>is it important for you? when you're with someone?</i>
<br><br>
<i>Sex? I could snap my fingers in the street and have sex with anyone I want. It's about the connection with the person, the tension, you know?  </i>
<br><br>
I think about this line from one of Marina's poems, 
<i>I want to want to masterbate.</i>

My favorite trains have a window to let you see out the back, so you can watch the cars following as you get pulled away from the buildings and the street 
    recedes. I watch my coworkers walking towards me on the sidewalk, holding hands, they came together from Mexico City, the man looks more embarrassing than usual, 
    his pants blowing wide and strange in the wind, he's wearing sneakers on the leaves, the woman's hair is pulled tight to her head like always, they both look down. 

<br><br>
<i>Can't you see we're at the edge of the harbor? and we have to leave to come back together? </i>
<br><br>
<div style="font-family: UTM_Times">
I watch an old video of Elliott Smith performing in 1997. He sits at the edge of a blue leather armchair and his leg won't stop shaking as he sings, behind the 
chair is a doorway the same deep blue, like the screen is saturated, and the blue engulfs the people standing there, except two, the types I'd see in Portland now, 
young and sitting in the doorframe, so that their faces can be seen, below Elliott's, as he rocks forward and back, looking behind the camera after each song, only for a moment, 
to the filmer, I wonder, like asking if it's going okay. He asks to sing without the microphone, his voice is soft. 
<br><br>
I'm frustrated. I'm always frustrated. When I was a kid I realized that, that I was always frustrated. That was my biggest emotion, frustration. And it always 
rushed inwards, when my glue didn't stick, when my book didn't look like it was supposed to. I want to learn a TOPS song on guitar, 
it doesn't matter which one, just one from <i>Picture You Staring</i>. But there's no bearded man on YT who's made a tutorial already, and the tabs are wrong, 
or just too complicated, and I realize again that I don't even know how to mute the strings. 
<br><br>
I've started thinking, <i>give yourself 15 years</i>, that started as a joke to myself because after k I said <i>give yourself one year</i>, but that might not be 
enough I realized. 
<br><br>
15 years is also a bit more than double the time that M and I were together, if you don't count the few months we broke up that one time. I can't really get into that 
right now.
<br><br>
<i>If I stayed up every night, could I get where I want? 
    <br>If I did more, If I was myself more, could I be who I want? 
</i><br><br>
I can't help but think about Elliott Smith watching that video, that he would never see himself like I see him. 
<br><br>
I finished <i>On Earth We're Breifly Gorgeous</i> in one day, today. I thought I wouldn't be able to get into it as much since the love interest (it's more 
of course, this is poetry!) shares the same name as my brother. But actually it was easy to imagine Trevor as myself instead.   
<br><br>
The part of the book that made me cry was unexpected, it wasn't any of the deaths, or my longing to be loved like Trevor, the loving descriptions of masculinity. 
It was the part when they have sex 'for real', and LD accidentally shits himself, and Trevor takes them to the river, and they bathe and Trevor returns to 
LD and sucks his dick in return, to show that he is still clean. 
<br><br> 
I never told you this but I worry often that I am unclean. A few months after k I realized that we'd only ever had sex on my period, and the last time, they'd 
gone down on me for a long time, I'd never come with them before, and they came up with blood in their mouth, and said it was good but I knew, I saw 
their disgust before they could hide it. 
<br><br>
The part about hating my vagina is printed now, anyone can read that, but it solidified in that memory. I realized that even if I'd imagined it, the risk was 
too great. 
I felt exposed when I thought about that, thought of someone touching my vagina and being repulsed, once the thought came it didn't leave, 
it became certain, I wished someone had bathed me then, and showed me that my thought wasn't true.

<i>[CW: sexual abuse, alcoholism]</i>
<br><br>
We are in a compound somewhere warm, between the roads are thin pine trees and the roads are made of rock and yellow dust. I'm walking with a group, we are deciding 
which road to take to get to the store, I see the large grey brick buildings ahead but we go a different way, down a smaller road and past adobe huts, we 
see someone far away down the road and wait for them. 
<br><br>
There is confusion about rooms, I end up with three old german women, I go out of the room and into a dark hall filled with water, everyone 
is sitting in chairs underwater, I swim to them but I can only see the back of their heads, k, hair floating up in the water, 
I try and grab them but I miss, I swim outside and the buildings are still like 
in a western, tall, with orange dust over them all, but it's also my home town, and I try and find my old house, but I get stuck on the 
walls of a building and can't make it, I know it's a dream 
then. 
<br><br>
I wake up and can't open my eyes fully, I try and turn but can't see everything, like I can't find any shape in the light, my eye lids are pulling down, I'm 
looking around the room for my clothes, the german women start talking to me, I move to their side of the bed and try and smile as my face is slurring down, 
my words are so hard to form, they are asking me more but I can't see their faces, I'm turning back and I find bags, of course, 
my bag, I remember bringing it the day before, I reach to my eyes and there is gauze over my left eye, I pull it down and blink but my vision still doesn't come, 
and I turn around the blurry room as the women watch.  
<br><br>
I wake up in my bed, and I hear my phone, it's messages from M, 
<br><br>
<i>Drew punched me in the face</i>
<br><br>
Then the slurred voice notes, he says he's going to sleep and I can't talk to him about it now anyway, his message ends with <i>I love you</i> and I know that 
he means it, but it's a kind that I know, and I can't take in. 
<br><br>
Someday it will be time for forgive my mother, maybe some day soon, maybe as soon as I can tell her what I'm about to tell you. I spoke with someone new last weekend 
and they told me a story on the train. They'd induced a vison of what it was like as a child, they 'were back', hiding from their mother in the closet, and later they 
told her about it. She was upset, but they didn't blame her, only told her the story, and they are much closer now.

    from Yowler:
    <br><br>
    My heart is a part of me, but she lies
    <br>I'm shining sea to sea, but it's not right 
    <br>You'll lose me in the trees, but I'm alive 
    <br><br>
    Your hands look just like mine and 
    <br>your voice went into my spine 
    <br>when I was just a gleam in your eye 
    <br><br>
    There were ghosts in the sidewalk, that night 
    <br>but the fear of them was absent 
    <br>with you by my side
    <br><br>
    And you can lead me to the water 
    <bR>but you cannot make me drink 
    <br>but you will not be avoided 
    <br>because your ghost is haunting me 
    <br>you made me in the spring time 
    <br>but my body met the cold 
    <br>you were crying in the corner 
    <br>and that fear is all I know. 
</i>
<br><br>
There was one night, things were getting worse towards the end of my senior year. I was never at home if I could avoid it, I would spend as much time as I could 
out with my friends, leaving early in the morning for work before they got up and coming home late after they'd gone to bed, at night I'd sneak out and sleep in my 
car a few times a week, sometimes just alone. If I was home I would bring my friends too, and they'd see the change too if it happened, and we could talk about it, 
more like it was interesting and dramatic and not my mother falling apart. But a few nights that year I remember, everyone else was hiding in their rooms, and she 
came up the stairs, there was a sound she made when she was drunk, a shuffling that I could hear anywhere in the house, a slowness that was so removed, and she 
heaved against the door, it had no lock, and I braced against it from the other side, and I yelled for her to stop, but she screamed for me to let her in, and it 
wasn't the first time I'd held the handle like that against her, until she pulled it open and forced herself in, her fingers reaching around the doorframe and I 
sat on my bed and watched her hunched form move around the room, black in my mind and her reaching for me on the bed, saying <i>I didn't know what sex was, that 
    she would teach me what sex was.
</i>
<br><br>
She only touched my face, maybe my arms, but I remember her insistence, and I sat in bed and pleaded with her to leave, and 
she looked at me from so far away, her skin loose on her face and there was no trace of her there. Eventually, I lead her away, down the steps, I put her in her 
room and held the door closed as she pushed against it, asking why I was doing this, saying I needed to listen to her and let her out, saying it wasn't right, since 
she was my mother.   
<br><br>
There were many nights like that, but I don't remember any sexual abuse, but there is a strange cloud that hangs around the memories of her touching me, that 
may have only came later, when I started to wonder. When I started therapy my therapist asked if I remembered anything, <i>perhaps there was nothing. 
    but with what you describe, and your symptoms..</i> but I also make many connections, and imagine many things, and does it matter in the end? What happened, 
    and what I wonder happened, how she acted when she wasn't there? There are no answers.  
<br><br>
I met a girl earlier this summer, we got close but I stayed a bit wary of her. We sat on the beach one night and she told me she'd been sexually abused as a child 
by her brother, 
I couldn't fully relate, but I understood, and her story was different in that it had broken open, her family knew now, whereas the memories I have have only 
drifted away, my mother back now, and loving, and completely different, as though she really was asleep those nights, and something else inhabited her body. 
<br><br>
I knew the girl liked me, but I still wasn't sure, there was something aggressive in her, and a faraway look that I recognized. The last night I drank, we were 
at the bar she worked at, I could feel that I was also far away, as though I was sitting deep behind my skin. I felt my face loosen, hanging down strangely, I 
went to the bathroom and put my face up to the mirror, it was like looking at a photograph of someone else, <i>I am beautiful</i> I thought, but not like a person, 
like a mask, like a sculpture, I pulled my hair over my eyes and stayed there for minutes, looking at her in the mirror, when I came out of the bathroom, K pulled 
me aside, <i>you look terrible</i>, the tips of my hair were stuck together with spit, my eyes in black sockets. We walked to another bar and the girl and I fell 
behind, I wanted to be desired, 
<br><br>
her, <i>you know I like you right?</i>
<br><br>
me, <i>yeah, I know.</i>
<br><br>
I stop, waiting with her at a corner in the dark, a man is unloading a fruit truck behind us, a light from above shines down, 
<br><Br>
me, <i>I just can't do this, I'm so afraid of something happening, it's going to be just like with k, I'm so avoidant, I'm going to pull away, 
    I'm not ready to trust someone yet. 
</i>
<br><br>I start to cry, she hugs me, 
<br><br>
her, <i>hey, it's okay, we don't have to be that serious, we can just have fun together, </i>
<br><br>
[silence]
<br><br>
<i>you have such beautiful eyes, I want to kiss you so badly—</i>
<br><br>
I pull back and she moves forward, our lips meet, I don't know what to do, she tastes sweet but I don't feel right,  
<br><br>
I pull back from her, I tell her we'll go on a date, I lead her back to my friends, and afterwards I decide not to talk to her anymore. 
<bR><br>
---
<br><br>
As I age I notice it more and more, the curve of my cheeks under my eyes, the way I 
smile, it's all her, with glasses on especially, and I dress like her, in layered blues and patterns, I feel like I live under her skin, to find me attractive is 
to find my mother attractive, to sleep with me is to sleep with my mother, I want to have my own face instead. 
<br><br>
I don't blame her, I don't blame M, I don't blame the girl, I don't blame myself. The mistakes happen like in a dream, the curving away from the true self to someone else, 
in the end, only one of us remembers the action, to the other it is blurred, and I'm left with someone far away from their mind, who cannot remember, who cannot see me.

<i>Ghosts</i>
<br><br>
<i>You see me as a ghost. How is it possible you can't see my edges, can't see how I stand on the sidewalk, how I watch the cars in the street, how I 
    call to you, how can you never turn towards me? To you, I feel nothing. To you, I am like the walls you look past, I am again in the closet of my 
parents house, looking up at the dark coats and sitting on the crumpled shoes. With you I am like a ghost, as though my words were never spoken, I want you 
to wonder about me, you don't care what I write, don't care what I say, even the things about you pass right through, I have no form, no skin you think of 
reaching towards, I am the forgotten buildings you pass, we are the two cities atop each other, I am the siren sound in the street and you continue walking, 
I am a curtain for the light, I am things in the grass you never noticed, I am the blue between you and the mountain far away, I am like the rest of the 
world you never saw.  </i>
<br><br>
I wake up to a text from my father, it's only a photo, of my mother sitting next to the family table with a cake lit with candles, she is alone, the chairs 
behind her are all empty and the room is dark, she smiles at the camera in her strange way, it looks strained, she is so far away from me. 
<br><br>
I immidiately think of another birthday, one when my dad came to ask me to make a card for my mother and I forgot, then she was crying, somewhere, maybe 
in the kitchen, and I didn't understand, she was drunk and crying and saying we didn't love her because I hadn't even made her a card, I ran up to the room 
and cut paper and glued it and made a card for her and when I brought it down she had already stopped crying, and she seemed embarrassed, but my dad 
thanked me, and I never saw my mom upset on her birthday again. 
<br><br>
I call my mom while I'm still in bed, and she answers because it's still not too late there, 
<br><br>
<i>Hi honey, it's nice to hear from you.</i>
<br><br>
<i>It's nice to hear from you too, happy birthday! Hope it was nice.</i>
<br><br>
<i>It was, I had so much great cake.</i>
<br><br>
<i>At home? I saw, dad sent me a photo, it looked amazing!</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes, at the office too, and your father got me a big cake.</i>
<br><br>
[silence]
<br><br>
<i>Well, what's going on with you today? It must be.. early morning? Early wednesday morning?</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes, I'm just going to work today. Last night my friend came and we made dinner together and stayed up until two just talking, it was really nice.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes,</i> 
<br><br>
[silence]
<br><br>
<i>Your father told me you had some event at the Swiss Embassy? Some demonstration recently, has that already happened?</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes, it was a few weeks ago, it was just like setting up our equipment and showing it to people, but it was fun and went really well.</i>
<br><br>
<i>That's good to hear, did you meet any bigwigs?</i>
<br><bR>
<i>I don't know, I couldn't really tell.</i>
<br><br>
[we laugh]
<br><br>
[silence]
<br><br>
<i>Well,</i>
<br><br>
<i>Thank you for calling sweetheart, let us know when you know when we'll be seeing you.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes I will, and I hope you sleep well.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Okay, bye honey!</i>
<br><br>
<i>Bye! Goodnight.</i>

<br><br>
The woman on the bike stops at the bottom of the hill, 
she wears two shades of blue, maybe one is periwinkle, the wheels lengthen, and touch the road.  
<br><br>
I go to a glasses store and pick out these cheap black frames, give me the ones that say the least, I don't care so much about how I look right now.  
<br><br>
K is adamant, <i>your twenties are for being alone and crying</i>, the real Diana Vreeland quote includes dancing but K adds that later. 
<br><br>
Pleasure doesn't matter so much right now, my appearance doesn't matter so much right now. You moved into me in a strange way, leaving me happier alone, 
and with so much more to think about.

My father's birthday today, and a month until I'm 25. I remember my mother looking at me through the bathroom mirror, pulling down her lips to show me her 
receding gums and the yellow stalks of her teeth. They looked normal to me. She says, <i>everything gets better until you're 25, then it's all downhill. </i>
<br><br>
My old friend reminds me on the phone that I'm losing sleep over an ameoba, <i>and they move slowly, plus it's cool to get your eye eaten</i>. I get to sleep sooner 
after that but it doesn't change the fact that bright lights and screens hurt my eyes now, and I get a strange pain, like pressure within the eye. Not to mention 
the tooth in my lower jaw that hurts when I eat now, the gum frantically brushed away, bringing it's pale yellow root to the surface. 
<br><br>
I try and tell myself It's Very Punk Rock to have strange maladies, but at night I am very sure now that I will die. I promise myself I'll masterbate 
every day now, and I think of getting back with my ex. Worst case, they're an asshole, but I already expected that, and what if I die before I love again?
<br><br>
I try thinking of my body like a building. I know from my building collapse YT videos that buildings can really take a lot, this is like the first leak, 
my roof flooding and the water seeping into a few rooms, weaking the ceiling slightly but mostly cosmetic, will be patched within the year and will leave 
only water stains, which I like the look of anyway. But you never fully know about the internal stucture, a missing bolt somewhere.
<br><br>
<i>Days</i>
<br><br>
In the field, lies an old farm house. Within the house, on the table, sits an egg, Gwendolyn's egg, bluegreen. In the morning, the bluegreen egg is 
taken from the straw and placed on the table, the sun rises from the mountains and warms the farmhouse and a sliver of the table, 
the egg is bluegreen, there are no people in the house. 
<br><br>
A tree out in the prairie looks strange. It is too big, a comb of branches that are too high and wide, the tree takes up the whole sky when I look that way. 
In the wind it takes the horizon too, turning it's branches and catching all the air, turning much more than the other trees, it is grey while they are green. 
<br><br>
There are other structures near the house. Metal tubes, spines and ribs, ivy covers many, you can see into some windows and there is a desk and a bookshelf, 
but outside it is cold and mostly made of metal, the sun sets every time I go there, and I watch it go down, leaving this place.

[<i>CW: This post is disturbing and unpleasant in many ways: gore, death of loved one, anxiety </i>]
<br><br>
<i>Where do I start and you end?</i>
<br><br>
I stand in the bathroom and look at my eye in the mirror. Red veins have emerged between the corner and my iris, and within the mass I swear I can 
see a perfect circle, outlined in red and glowing dull grey. Like another eye has fallen in. 
<br><br>
I dream that night that I'm going on a trip with my parents. Before we leave we go to my grandmother's house to say goodbye, but we can't find her. I search the rooms 
and the empty hallways until my parents say we'll find her later, and we drive away. Two weeks later we come back to the house, everything is like we left it, every room 
is empty. We search and call for her until I notice the sound of flies, circling near the ceiling, all trailing from one room.    
<br><br>
When I start to believe I'm going blind, what I see starts to change. White surfaces begin to look more black, I begin to see faint crosshatch, fuzziness, 
like TV static, surrounding me in white rooms, between myself and objects I see only a strange blurriness hanging in the center of the room, and the halo of lights, now lasting 
minutes, hours, burning the negative image of chairs, tables, into my retina, superimposing my room into the laboratory, everything pressed and darkening onto 
everything else. 
<br><br>
In the dream I follow the flies, to her bathroom, tucked behind her bed, through a small door we never checked, her arms and legs hang from the tub, 
 I close the door and tell my parents, <i>she was dead before we left</i>, my mom laughs, <i>so it didn't matter anyway</i>. 
<br><br>
At night, I watch the red curl and spread under the edge of my contact, thinking of what it will be like to be blind, that I'll have time to think then, 
can learn to write though speaking, that the dark is only another room, that it's good to always change, that I'll feel wind differently then, and pay more attention 
to voices. I imagine being left with only what I've seen, to recombine and imagine more, I try and feel good about that. 
<br><br>
But I worry about the clear blue iris, as the grey mass throbs and breathes in the mirror at night, slowly growing from the white tissue and soon to break the 
surface. The nice eyes, that look just like my mother's, <i>you have such beautiful eyes</i>, the strangest beauty, the only beauty that I couldn't control, 
but could lose, I see now, the risk of things that come easy, and never really felt like mine.   
<br><br>
I fall asleep and dream again, this time I cannot open my eyes, the lids heavy and sloping down, one after the other, I stand in the bathroom of my 
grandmother's house and watch halves of my vision go dark, I try and pull the lids open but my vision is slow and blurred, I hold the walls as I walk 
down the hallway. I realize that I know this feeling, and that it comes in dreams, so I close both eyes and move deeper, leaving the 
house and waking in my bed. 
<br><br>
I explain my symptoms to the eye doctor, <i>redness, light sensitivity, pain from contact lenses</i>, he prescibes me eye drops for seasonal allergies. 
When I go home I see that the red veins have faded, the circle barely visible now, back to hiding within the lens.
