<i>C,</i>
<br><br>
The powerlines between our houses, stay through the rain. 
<br>I never knew you went there too
<br>circled the hum of the wires
<br>to the place beneath the lines 
<br>where the sky forms it's own current. 
<br><br>
What did you think of? When you'd leave 
<br>the yard beyond the trailer heading 
<br>to a shadow below the foothills.
<br>Of course, we were once children 
<br>there, but in a dream, 
<br>did I only imagine the day we walked down the tracks 
<br>and found a pit lined with quartz 
<br>reflecting each afternoon.  
<br><br>
Now the side of that road is where we 
<br>found 
<br>that we didn't need to keep driving 
<br>that at some point we 
<br>could turn to each other 
<br><br>
and through your mouth I could return then
<br>to the torn and thoughtless grass.

<i>poststroke</i>
<br><br>
I woke in the morning and put my hand to my thigh, finding the indent of my pelvis now caved upwards, the hard shell of an egg laid in the night, the pain, 
was unbearable. 
<br><br>
I couldn't make out your face at first, like your features were always shifting. When I turned to you in the dark club your face blurred, I realized immidiately 
that I could never control you. So I let you lead, filling in every gap I could. 
<br><br>
In the hospital, I was afraid and nauseous, the fruit within me was not a new life at this point but only a foreign body. The nurse squeezed the growth and told me 
my intestines had broken out of their lining, routine procedure, she rolled the ball with her palm until it was almost flat, I pretended the pain was gone and 
went home to lie on the floor.  
<br><br>
I don't remember the moment that your face crystalized, when you became the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen. Before this, your body had reminded me of the 
caterpillars I used to grow, the ones that didn't eat enough before they pupated, and remained green leather, calloused and small.
<br><br>
When I returned to the hospital I walked bent at the hip, could no longer straighten my thin body. I swept across the street like grass in the wind. A passerby asked me if I 
needed a wheelchair but I could not relinquish my legs, my knees, still holding stiff.  
<br><br>
The infection turned my body red that night. When I stood up, my chest was wooden, the sheets were my blood, on fire beneath the skin. The doctors began to whisper 
above my bed, using the words <i>flesh-eating</i>.
<br><br>
No one's form has moved outside the world like yours. I did not know my eyes could see like that. When your face first felt like God we were sitting in a 
bakery, one too nice, our conversation always stuttering, and your eyes lit by sun through the blinds, the softest brown that they were also green. 
<br><br>
In the early morning they removed the growth with a scalpel, leaving the wound open for months, to drain. That spring, I could look directly into the hole 
left in my body, red walls that led to cherry darkness. No longer inhabited by the routine bacteria, which my body had chosen not to fight. 
<br><br>
I never knew my body could give out, become overwhelmed from within. I know now I'll surrender someday. You dulled everyone around me.
