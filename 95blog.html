From <i>Prairie Style</i> by C.S. Giscombe : 
<br><br>
<i>To have the same sound, to be called by the same name.</i>
    <br><br>
    Location's what you come to; it's the low point, it usually repeats.
    <br><br>
    To me, any value is a location to be reckoned with; I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how an event 
    could be talked about like it was you or me being talked about.
    <br><br>
    Or location's the reply, the obvious statement about origin; it goes without saying that pleasure's formidable.
<br><br>
-------------------------------
<br><br>
<i>To have the same sound, to be called by the same name.</i> 
<br><br>Enumclaw is the name of my hometown, in 2019 Enumclaw became the name of a garage rock band from Tacoma. 
<br><br>
I have one guitar pick, it's yellow and smudged and I caught it at an Enumclaw show. Sometimes the pick is in my wallet if I take my guitar 
somewhere, once I didn't notice and handed the pick to the bartender with my cash, he said nothing and set it down on the counter. 
I thought it was the Pfand token and gave it back with my glass.  
<br><br>
<i>Location's what you come to; it's the low point, it usually repeats.</i> 
<br><br>My favorite poet is Tony Tost, I found him through the Enumclaw wikipedia 
page. He grew up in a double-wide mobile home and worked at the pickle factory on Old Pickle Factory road, he studied Gertrude Stein and has two books, <i>Invisible 
    Bride </i> and <i>Complex Sleep</i>, he produced the show <i>Longmire</i>. In the mornings I like to read the stuff he posted on Blogger in 2007, 
    he writes: 
<br><br>
<i>Swans of Local Waters
<br><br>
Their color is not a product of the water’s depth; their quiet is not lake’s. These are accidents floating in simple water, taking in nature calmly, 
in little sips; actions which, like literal swans and lakes, are sometimes scattered. What the swans look like: white, with feathers. It’s getting cold. 
Someone has made a fire. A flame’s identity depends on what it burns — identity is like a swan for it comes and goes as it pleases.
<br><br></i>
I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge an event. The other link on the Enumclaw wikipedia page titled 'Enumclaw Horse Sex Case'.
Man found dead in an Enumclaw stable by ruptured colon after being penetrated by a horse 
those in the online horse-fucking forums affectionately called, 'Big Dick', the man's own username, 
'Mr. Hands'. A landmark case in beastiality legislation and the focus of <i>Zoo</i>, winner of 
16 awards at Sundance. 
<br><br>
<i>it goes without saying that pleasure's formidable.</i>
<br><br>
I lost my viginity on a logging road in Enumclaw, in the back of a Subaru RX with stickers that looked like bandaids on the bumper. 
My grandma was Mrs. Enumclaw. They call Enumclaw the plateau. 
The next time Mount Rainier erupts Enumclaw might be hit with a 100 m tall wave of volcanic ash and glacial melt 
the consistency of concrete. If the winds blow East, the lahar will hit Buckley instead. 
<br><br>
At the Enumclaw pool I sat mornings in the lifeguard chair and watched sun come through the window over lines of winkled skin whirling and 
churning like barn swallows, wondering: if water is trapped between feathers, are birds always hooked to the lake?

<i>Found on the ground:</i>
<br><br>
<i>I can't do this. I look like I crochet balaclavas, like I paid 70 euros for a 'working class' 
    haircut (I did) and yes, I'm about to tell you I write poetry.   
<br><br>
If Life Is But A Joke, if we envision the role of the poet as a communicator, or maybe a mediator, or maybe a great conversationalist, then really 
I'm working desperately towards just being understood. But not by anyone, because what good is it if the people I understand don't understand me? And 
understanding is shorthand for love in this context, and love is shorthand for being very curious about me.  
<br><br>
And so if this is our yardstick I've really not done much at all, have I? Because I fell in love with someone who wasn't really very interested in me. So 
these two years now I've sat in my room writing and raving and researching and practicing thinking, it all just hasn't been enough has it? Because when the moment 
came, I still couldn't show them who I was. 
<br><br>
And another thing, I don't know jack shit about any of this. While the people I love and want to love me back were writing their dissertations on Ezra Pound 
I was learning the latin names of 400 species of birds. I don't know how to write and I'm supposed to be reading about modern methods of fruit fly 
genetics but the person I love doesn't care about that. 
<br><br>
I was born with a curse. The dream is happening around me every day and I need you to see it too, I need to learn how to show it to you 
so that you understand. But it hasn't been working, 
<br><br>
I write lots and lots of words, I tell you every thing I know, I tell you the color of every object in my dream, they are always blue. I tell you 
this is all happening at night, you don't seem to care.

A slay day, a lovely day. I went to a club with my new roommate (from Melbourne, no relation) last night, we sat in the kitchen drinking gin mixed with yerba mate and talked 
about our failed high school relationships until we left for the club at 12:30, we bought beers at the Späti and I felt the old 
nostalgic excitment of being tipsy and wandering around in Germany come back. <br><br>
This morning I woke up energized, I texted everyone that my phone had broke and now I have a new number, something I was naturally embarrassed about 
since I had to text some random people from Hinge that have ghosted me (because what if they ever want to come back?) but this morning I just did it and didn't 
care. I went to my old apartment and picked up some mail, then wandered around in the sunshine listening to fanclubwallet. My buddy Jamie asked what I 
was doing today and we made plans to get drinks later, I went home and my roommate and I did a news quiz together while we made lunch, I made some 
coffee and walked to a park near my apartment and wrote in a new notebook I just got at Muji. 
I was listening to Parquet Courts <i>Human Performance</i> and watching the people throwing balls for the dog, the kids playing 
on the play structure, the clouds rolling in.  
<br><br>
I came back home when I finished my page and then played guitar for a bit, tried to learn the opening riff to <i>Berlin Got Blurry</i>, then I made 
dinner and went on E2 for a while, now I'm here. I'm coming back into myself and I'm so excited. I'm trusting that I'm fun to be around and that people like 
me, and I'm enjoying being alone with myself too. I'm so happy that I'm here, it feels right and incredibly good. I feel like I'm getting a present 
every time I walk outside and see all of the things I love about Berlin, the weird shit left on the street and the old grey buildings with people leaning 
out and smoking from their windows. I feel like me describing how happy I am isn't particularly fun to read or interesting so I'll wrap it up but basically, 
I am so happy I am here.

he'd wake up early and load me and my brother in the truck. We'd drive through the gravel roads and I'd watch the steam rise from the coffee in his thermos. 
We'd hike all morning as the sky turned pink and the frost broke on the pine needles under our boots.  
<br><br>
My dad said he liked hunting because it was the cheapest way to get venison, and he liked going out to the woods. 
But come November there were always new antlers mounted in the garage, and photos on his computer of deer 
carcasses hung on two by fours between the trees. 
<br><br>
When I got older I stopped going hunting with my dad. In October I waited with my mom in the living room, 
<br><br>
she said 'I hope Joseph gets a deer this year, he's always so discouraged when he doesn't' 
<br><br>
My dad needed the deer in the bed of the truck, he needed to tell his friends how far he followed it, how quickly he made the final shot, he needed them to 
imagine him holding the rifle. 
<br><br>
Even the death of the deer is sometimes unnecessary. Sometimes all that matters is that it runs. 
<br><br>
The week after the shooting I was afraid to go to work, the next months I realized everything was different.
I began to think strange things, like that my memories 
might be made up, that I had been saved by God, that I was living in a dream. 
Many things within the minute of the shooting became important. The flexing of the tendon of his hand,
the words he yelled at me before he shot. These all told me things. 
<br><br>
I would never erase the shooting. I can connect with people so differently now. 
I have felt the strange ways that trauma 
changes our perceptions of others and ourselves, 
I am no longer naive to how fragile and malleable the way I see the world is. 
<br><br>
This means I can also tell things to myself. Like that I'm safe, and that I am loved, and that I am stronger than the shooter. 
Because he needed me to feel something about himself, but I don't need him.

I had my soil ecology test this morning, it went well I think. I've been busy this weekend studying for it, which has been nice in a way, of course, 
all of my usual thoughts were still there, always. It reminded me of how my 4th grade teacher told us to chew gum while we studied, i.e. no matter what I 
was reading or what time of day or how my I wrote, my thoughts floated around the background like some faint peppermint bullshit. 
<br><br>
It made me think of this E2 post I read forever ago about a man who meets a priest on a mountain top (etc) and is instructed that he'll be happy once 
he can have no thoughts for 30 minutes, so he practices every day first trying to go only 1 second without thinking and then 2 and then after an 
entire lifetime he can finally go 30 minutes and I think he's really happy or like dead or something at that point. This might actually not have come from E2, 
anyway the point is I'm practicing not thinking. 
<br><br>
When I was a kid and having the can't-sleep anxiety (I'm trying to write about this right now but I'm stalled because I'm realizing writing about 
my childhood bedroom is deeply lame) my mom got this book from the library to help me, I imagine it must have been about bad dreams or dealing with anxiety or 
something, but I remember her reading one section that advised that if you were thinking about something unpleasant just superimpose a nice thought 
in your mind, like thinking of ice cream. The book asked, <i>Can you visualize an ice cream cone in your mind? What color is it? How much detail can you 
add to the image? 
</i>
<br><br>
<i>Mom: You can try imagining something nice when you start to have thoughts you don't like, you control your thoughts.</i>
<br><br>
I think many would disagree with this idea that we control our thoughts, and find it actually quite condescending. In the E2 post the man didn't try and replace his 
thougths, he said that he tried to just let them pass, not becoming angry that he was thinking, but just letting them flow freely and pass by. Of course everyone 
fucking knows that, 
<br><br>
I'm trying to reroute myself slowly, trying not to be mad at the thoughts but also move away from them, not towards them. When I realize I'm there I'm 
trying to softly course correct, like slipping a paddle into the water. I can't tell if it's working yet, but I am feeling better and better.

After I read last night a few different people came up to me and told me that they really enjoyed my writing. This man from Brooklyn said he 
loved the way that I craft the story, someone else said they loved how quickly I accessed the emotion in my 
<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://everything2.com/title/claimed+cowboy?author_id=2200538#fliphone" target="_self">
 poem,
    </a> that one was k actually. But 
on the bus too, I walked with my friend Will and they told me them and their partner had come a few weeks ago, when I did the cockroach one, and that their partner 
always talks about it and asks if I've read again. My friend Sophia Rose said that she was inspired by my lucid dream piece last week, my friend Kat just 
said she loved everything. 
<br><br><i>
W: When do you usually write?
<br><br>
H: I write all the time. 
<br><br>
W: But like I usually write in the mornings, do you have a time that you..?
<br><br>
H: No. I've been writing compulsively at all hours of the day, I wake up and all I want to do is write, in the middle of the day I have to 
    structure my other work to keep myself from writing, I write at night, I write on the train, when I'm not writing I'm thinking of what I will write 
    soon. 
<br><br>
W: That's such a gift you know. </i>
<br><br>
I'm in an interesting place. I can feel I'm returned to a semblance of the <i>heidelberg period</i>, back when I was happy, unbothered by everything because all I wanted 
to do was work on my blog. Last night I sat on the bus going home and felt so content, I'd talked to my friends, I'd made new ones, I'd had fun and people liked 
my writing. When I got off the tram I ran home in my cowboy boots under the moon and the cold sky and smiled all by myself. 
<br><br>
I read my tarot cards this morning and listened to the sound of the cards as I shuffled, the pages of the book turning, it felt grounding and calm, 
sitting on my bed as the sun rose and I could watch the sky turn pink to blue. First I read k, of course I still think about them, as much as I don't want to 
admit it. I finally got a letter from them yesterday, this letter was finally vulnerable, I could feel their thin tendrils 
of honesty, which at last, gave my power back. They told me they knew the problem was unrequited love, that we simply don't work, and not because they 
can't access emotion or whatever bullshit they've been saying, but just because they don't love me, and that love doesn't make sense. 
<br><br>
I liked the letter, it was finally in line with how I've been seeing things (re: the pool of unrequited love) and I liked that they included a second letter 
they'd written later, saying they had been afraid to send it since they didn't want to come off too harsh, but that they wanted to talk about love more with me. It 
was the backdoor M had been warning me about, that k will always try and pull me back one more time. They're afraid of losing control of people, so 
they need me to say that I want to continue to talk with them. I thought it was funny they were worried about it being too harsh, as if I haven't already built my 
own self back from falling into a disassociative pit the last two months. I do feel incredibly strong now, since I found my way out of the <i>underworld</i>
basically on my own. 
<br><br>
My cards literally told me, <i>it's time to pack your bags and get moving, there's nothing left for you here, it's time to look to the horizon and 
    keep moving forward. </i> And then told me that again, and again. I believe them too, I've been thinking about the beauty of giving k unrequited love. 
    Not mine anymore, but theirs, because I think they're going to regret what happened. Their cards showed that they are about to enter a period of 
    rebirth and creativity, but reversed, and also involving the death card; I don't think they'll like it, but I'm hoping I can give them the beauty they've 
    given me, the pain and reflection and the growth that I feel now.

<b><i>Wolbachia</i></b>
<br><br>
It emerged slowly, doctors said it had been present since birth, probably passed from my mother, and suspended, waiting, within the follicles that pupate 
the ridges of my seminal tract, a small thing, a burrowed worm sleeping between the cytoplasm walls, until provoked by 
<i>an unknown mechanism</i>, maybe the necessity of time, maybe the chemicals which formed my wings,  <br>
what was one cell became two, 
<br>a pulsing colony began to spread it's arms through the funnels of my reproductive system, then moved to my lymphatic, whispering new instructions 
to the enzymes working in my brain, I was only 20. 
<br><br>
I woke one morning with a growth the size of a mango above my thigh, I lay in bed looking up at the ceiling and touched the new extension of my body, 
I was afraid. Doctors couldn't find the reason, but they cut into the growth and removed the colony, 
taking the stems but not the roots. What was only skin above my thigh was left a pink scar. The infection left my skin and hid within my eyes.    
<br><br>
I remember the day when you told me you didn't feel right. It took months for you to reveal the 
size of the growth, how much of you was now enclosed by the corral, all that had changed. I listened in your living room, there was nothing to be done.    
<br><br>
I took your hand at night and curled my body around yours, together we lay in <i>Wolbachia</i> soup, we gave a name to the intruder, and he became part of us.

I remembered last week that I'm a voyeur. I'd been playing my guitar in the evenings just sitting in my desk chair pointed at the curtains when I realized: 
I can just spy on my neighbors. 
<br><br>
My new apartment is wonderful, it's large block buildings arranged in small squares and courtyards, so I can see the entire wall of the neighboring building 
from my window, each row 2 or 3 apartments, many people leave their curtains open in the evening and I slowly play <i>Angeles</i> over and over as I watch 
my neighbors reading to their kid in the drawing room, or the old couple that loves to smoke together in the kitchen, or the men who live alone and cook 
rice.
<br><br>
Last night, the clouds had cleared and I could see Orions Belt drifting over the other roof, it was like a dream, the patchwork of still-yellow windows, 
the people moving and talking and smoking, me making my own music, my fingers sliding on the wrong strings in the dark and slowly correctly, rewiring the 
sound until it matched the stillness of the night outside. I keep my lights off so I can't be seen, and I think about how I can do this every night. Every night 
I can come to my window and feel something I've dreamed about since childhood, seeing into the windows, uninterrupted, alone. 
<br><br>
But do I want to be alone? Of course I thought of k last night too, that nobody was there to appreciate me being so beautiful and cultivating such a beautiful vibe 
in the studio. I have this need for validation when experiencing beautiful things, as if the feeling can't be as strong if it's only me there. I understand this in a 
way, because sharing something beautiful with someone else forms a bond. The question is then, can viewing beautiful things alone bond you to yourself? What does that 
even mean? 
<br><br>
I'm thinking specifically of the <i>street light</i> outside my house in Auburn, the one I used to go out to the porch to watch for hours. I didn't want my 
mom or my dad to understand the <i>street light</i> , and I definitely didn't want to try and explain my fascination with it to my friends at school. I've 
been thinking of going tagging alone, I want to get back in touch with this part of myself, the part that knows where the beautiful things are: night, trainyards,
broken windows, and just wants to see them because I love them, not because I need someone else to see that they are beautiful too. I wonder what that would feel like? 
To explore something beautiful that only I will ever see, I wonder when that idea got so far away from me?
