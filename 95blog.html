A few lost days here and there, a few days spent between the floor boards. 
<br><br>
I wouldn't say things are going <i>great</i> with the whole Germany thing, I got an email back from the school I was interested in - they said I'll need 
    to be basically native-speaker-type-fluent in order to take classes there. That wasn't exactly <i>good</i> news. Then my German professor here 
        at PSU said, H---- I can't help you with this at all, frankly I'm not sure why you are asking me, why would I know anything about graduate school 
        in Germany, I'm here aren't I? No, she didn't say that, but it was between the lines. 
        <br><br>
Well, I'll keep it moving. The last few days I think I've gone numb, like repeated hands in the fire. 
<br><br>
I'll just keep trying, maybe going to school here wouldn't be so bad, so long as I could move for a while. Maybe I just need to take steps towards the 
individual things that matter to me? i.e. talking to hot people

I got around to doing my year tarot spread, my theme of the year is the eight of swords - not the highest swords but we're getting there! Kim Kranz describes as follows:
<br><br>
<i> Surrounded by obstacles and threats on all sides, you find yourself the victim. You see no way out, no available choices. Your perceptions 
    keep you from opening your wings and taking flight. What keeps you suspended here? Yourself or others? The Eight of Swords demands an answer. You 
    cannot hang here much longer. </i>
<br><br>
She even had the audacity to draw the card as a butterfly (we read: moth) pupa hanging precariously above a bed of swords, presumably before the moth will 
climb out - dry its wings - and take flight, the swords below revealed to be merely an illusion.

I just can't seem to move, I can't seem to get to it. 
<br><br>
I don't feel well. 
<br><br>
Moving Right Along: B's Blog (Breezeblocks) got me thinking about legacy today, which is always a bad sign. 
<br><br>
I think we all fantasize about having our writing published posthumously, it's fantasically passive to think about someone else valuing your work 
so much that they do everything for you - all the editting and the fretting about whether anyone will even like it. Plus, you don't have to go through 
the embarrassment of peddling your thoughts around, the hubris of saying 'yeah, I actually think you guys should listen to me on this one'. It sounds 
delightful. Of course, you do give up control. I'm thinking particularly of the tale of old Nietzsche's nazi-loving sister. Still, you are dead anyway, 
and future historians can probably sort the whole thing out. 
<br><br>
I think I like this sort of thing, passivity. Perhaps not in a way that I should. I was thinking today that if someone offered me to be back in the hospital 
with an exploding lymph node for a week I would take it. I would be so glad to be taken care of, to finally have absolutely nothing to do and no reason to 
pull up my god forsaken knotted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15nberWl0EU" target="_self">crummy crusty</a> bootstraps. I could just lay there 
letting god take my hand and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD__QQvknXU" target="_self">lead me as They pleased.</a>
<br><br>
Earlier this week, L and I talked about why I am restricting food. I told her it's because I'm trying to signal that I need help. But Help's A Fickle Thing and 
I realized as I was talking with her that I don't actually want any help at all. I mean, sure, if someone could just figure out what I'm doing for me that would 
be great - but it also wouldn't, because I probably wouldn't even like what they came up with. I think that I want support but I don't even know what that would look 
like, so I'm just restricting food into the abyss. That's kinda how mental illness goes though, huh, it doesn't usually make sense. 
<br><br>
I think I need routine, or maybe rest. Or perhaps Prozac? I just don't feel like moving forward, mostly because the place I am feels so dismal, why 
walk when there is only another dark tunnel ahead?

Ummm. hey guys. 
<br><br>
I think I accidentally made my blog too clean and then stopped wanting to write on it. A few years ago I had this old notebook I repurposed from my intro to 
calc class or something and goddamn that was a good notebook, it was like falling apart, and yellow, and had coffee spilled on it a bunch of times. I wrote in that 
thing daily. Then it got stolen out of M's car, anyway. 
<br><br>
I invited the folks from E2 to my blog, if any of you guys are reading this - glad you made it... crazy weather we're having right now, huh? 
<br><br>
To get into it - the last few days I've felt a bit strange. I keep ending up drinking too much coffee and then being unable to form long-form thought. It's like 
I'm bumbling around <a href="https://everything2.com/user/dem+bones/writeups/Add+Me+On?lastnode_id=" target="_self">(babbling about)</a> and staying right 
outside my ability to think straight. This is what happens when you can't use weed, let me be a cautionary tale. 
<br><br>
I went through all my old posts, cleaning things up a bit, and I guess it taught me a few things. They weren't as bad as I was expecting, most I still respect. I talk a lot about Germany, which is sweet - wanting to go there, wanting to be there, wanting to stay there. I 
met with L today too and talked about this, can we call it a hyperfixation? I think I need to chill out, but also I'm not sure where chilling out will get me? I'll 
feel better? Okay. But maybe I should just let my anxiety take this one and I'll ride 'em like an old filly ("ain't never met a filly that could throw me" - 
Brokeback Mountain (2005)). 
<br><br>
Another point: I wish I was a higher level on E2 just so I could put this photo on my profile (young kafka):

At least it's good to have goals. The problem is: how do you cope when your goals are so all-consuming that you appear to be wildly depressed and struggle to 
find any reprieve in any activity that you try and do? The thing is, I desperately don't want to do anything. I feel like I'm bare-minimum existing, and daydreaming - 
all the time. Here's my new one:
<br><br>
I'm back in Berlin (side note: my computer booted up with a picture of the Brandenburg gate today, how fucking dare ??), I'm in the middle of the giant 
asphalt plaza (not limp/nor stale) that is Tempelhof airport, I'm back at the music festival watching <i>Enumclaw</i> perform, I yell up to them that Holy Shit I'm 
FROM Enumclaw ! The main guy sees me and is like, no way! I say 'Yeah I'm A MotherFucking Horse Fucker' we all laugh. C is there and we're married, also to <i>Enumclaw</i>. 
they're part of the polycule too.
<br> it's really good to have goals.

                I have a favorite mug. Sometimes I don't like to think that I do, since I have so many mugs that I like i.e. have been gifted by close friends, 
                have sweet memories attached to them, remind me of old feelings and old things that I used to do, or still carry the tea stain of this or that time, 
                similar to cliff-side stratigraphy. But I have only one favorite mug. It's on the small side, the size of your hands clasped together. It's white 
                with a cute little clef note for a handle, and on the top it has a ring of fifteen tiny strawberries, a thin green border, and two big strawberries 
                entwined, drawn in that speckled classroom style, and colored in just plain green and red, simple as can be. 
                <br><br>
                Sometimes the mug itself can transport me, other times it is a vehical for me to move myself. I used to connect the mug with a hardened memory or perhaps 
                it was really a tightly held dream. 
                In the memory my mom has taken me to her friends house to play, the friend and most of the walls and
                contents of the house never appear, just a downward view of the kitchen sink (stainless steel) as though I am standing far above it, perhaps held? On the 
                white wax sill of the kitchen window are many glass trinkets and a small spongey orange frog. I love the frog, I see wood cabinets and dirty brown carpet, 
                I am new, and seeing for the first time with eyes that are hooked to memory, long, long cords of memory. 
                <br><br>
                After the new association between my strawberry mug and the orange frog, the mug began to gain power. Now I can make it show me other happy little notes, 
                like itchy sawdust, sidewalk chalk, green gardens. It's kitsch, sure, but I place a high price on nostalgia. Why live if we do not spend time 
                looping through our favorite memories? Plus, some people say that growing up is only learning to love again what you did as a child. I find my mug 
                meditative, maybe even grounding, although I worry that using it when I'm really lost could form new tainted associations, so instead I usually seek it 
                out when I'm feeling just plain. My crystal ball to mundanity.

                Yesterday, M and I went to the beach to see some thirty foot waves promised on the news. The day was stormy and blustery and much of our 
                drive was spent winding through dark forest trees that swayed and shook their mossy arms over our heads. Rain was everywhere, sometimes turning the windshield into a blurry mess
                when the wipers couldn't keep up. It was really coming down in sheets, as though you could see the lines of rain in the air coming in 
                vertical waves, the sky looked like rippling fog. 
                <br><br>
                On our way home, M asked me about my plans for going back to Germany. I happened to be looking towards the line of beach houses out to the 
                west, focusing on one in particular that formed three concrete sections, harsh things that sloped down to reveal a car parked beneath its 
                sallow body. The far wall was open, a bright square of light that showed through to the sand spraying from the ocean and the ocean itself, another body. 
                <br><br>
                I pretended to be thinking about the question and instead thought about labyrinths. About hopelessness. 
                <br><br>
                I answered agressively and then went back to picking apart the open window, the bright square of light that appeared sunk below the belly 
                of the neighborhood. Thought about turning around and around in that concrete, looping through tunnels to come out at that sea window. Thinking 
                you've gotten close enough.

                Been thinkin' a lot about 2002. Probably due to Everything 2, which of course peaked in popularity around that time. I wanted to write a hommage to 
                one of my current favorite nodes on the site:
                <br><br>
                I was riding shotgun in the Acura on a peculiar blue day at the beginning of the Christmas holiday. My partner needed to get gas at Freddys 
                since was freshly under 4 dollars - everyone else in Clackamas must have had the same thought because the pumps were thronged with 
                cars all huffing and puffing cold exhaust in the mid day sun. We were behind a dirty CRV with vulva bumper stickers and two greasy lesbians at the 
                wheel. Behind us was a shitty red pickup holding the object of my affection, disheveled Tank soon to become a folk hero of my mind. He was lighting 
                up a bowl in the cab of his truck, through the rearview window behind his head waved large grasses and ferns in dirt buckets, the fronds so tall they surrounded 
                his cab in his own personal ecosystem. Tank was slow, languid, lovely. I thought about him leaving his landscaping job to wait for gas in the Fred Meyers parking lot, 
                how he made out quiet so none of his favorite co-workers would ask to come, then let time come to a stop as he inhaled and exhaled the weed he grabbed from his 
                center console. When it was Tank's turn at the gas pump he got out and tried to help the attendant, walking circles around the truck and revealing to me, his 
                guardian angel, his god, his shiny belt buckle. Tank gave the attendant a dopey smile and watched the pump, eyes never meeting mine. When Tank drove off into the 
                neighboring Taco Bell drive thru I felt grief, that I would never know him. Moreso, that I would never be him. That I was fated to anxiously weave the memories 
                of passing ants like him into my daily life while he waited calmly at the pump, looking bashfully at the cracked concrete. Call me, Tank.

                        Yes, I'm starting 2023 with a clean slate, launching a newer yet older version of StreeTrees. I've wanted to 
                        recreate Windows 95 for a long time, yet never had the patience (n)or time to fully implement my vision for 
                        the site. Pulling up my old blog now feels like a cheap prototype, which has been a common theme in this 
                        web-journey. I'm considering adding a few poems to the archive folder that I want to keep lugging around, 
                        but otherwise I'm looking forward to a new <b>START</b> to StreeTrees.
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted to launch with a brief rememberance of what I've accomplished this year (in the virtual 
                        realm) and a look ahead too. After all, what is more 90s than dreaming? 
                        <br>
                        <br><b>StreeTrees Version 1:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br> ☆ The blog was launched on Github for the first time on April 21st 2022, I didn't even take a screenshot 
                        on my computer at the time so all I have is a few screenshots from my phone showing the first version. This version 
                        included a blog and writings pages, the original name of the blog "CYBER HUNTER" in large ascii letters, and 
                        a few cyberpunk type gifs. 
                        <br><br>

                        <img src="v1.0.png" width="20.25%" style="border-style:inset">

                        </div>
                        <br>
                        ☆ About a week later V.1.1 was released, adding a more cohesive 90's coffee-house aesthetic. I changed to a calmer brown 
                        background and added the first music to the site, Zero 7's <i>Polaris</i>. This was the start of adding story and 
                        ambiance to the site itself, independent of my writing. This version also included a music page.
                        <br><br>
                        <div align="center">

                        </div>
                        </br>
                        ☆ On May 13th I released V.1.2 bringing this epic background and a more exciting entry page with bulletin 
                        board elements to provide updates and nonsense. I actually don't hate this format and will probably 
                        return to it if more people start to visit the site again. I think about 5-6 people were semi-regular viewers 
                        at this point so we could perhaps consider this StreeTrees golden era, although the background did become overwhelming 
                        I admit.  
                        <br><br>
                        <div align="center">
                          <img src="v.1.2.png" width="70%" style="border-style:inset">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        ☆ V.1.3 was released around May 28th and kept largely the same bulletin board style but with less abrasive 
                        colors and a bit more free format, I added a guest board and a few links to other pages with individual stories 
                        /writings/videos. I also changed to the name Street Trees at this point and started the official streetrees domain. 
                       <br><br>
                        <div align="center">
                          <img src="v.1.3.png" width="70%" style="border-style:inset">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        ☆ V.1.4 is lost to time but I remember it as a shittier version of V.1.5 without the tab links at the top of the 
                        page. It was also during this time that I started adding a page before the landing page that would hold old art films. Remember 
                        the australia one? Or the really long one about Berlin streetlights? V.1.5 was released July 12th and the site remained 
                        virtually unchanged until this new V.2.1. This previous version included a cleaner landing page and cute 
                        rounded boxes to put poems and songs. I also used 90s textbook covers to create the title visuals and DALLI to create 
                        AI paintings that would fit this theme. 
                        <br><br>
                        <div align="center">
                          <img src="v.1.5.png" width="70%" style="border-style:inset">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        All of this is to say, I'm happy with the progress that I've made in coding over the last year. I know that I'll look
                        back at this version in another year and be amazed at how simplistic it is, but that's the fun of web design. Also, 
                        the joy of having noone around. Still, it was very motivating to have people viewing StreeTrees regularly and I do 
                        hope to be ready to take the site public (!) in the coming year. My hopes for V.2.1 are:
                        <br><br>
                        ☆ More long-form writing that stands on its own or is part of larger projects. Individual pages dedicated to 
                        stories in progress or finished chapters. 
                        <br><br>
                        ☆ Creating music to accompany elements of the site i.e. poetry with synth ambiance 
                        <br><br>
                        ☆ More focus on community elements like connection to forums and other blogs that I like, as parquet 
                        courts always says <b>it's all community!</b>
                        <br><br>
                        If you are reading this, thank you. This blog has helped me to feel confident in my ability to create and 
                        express myself - something that I've struggled to feel ownership of throughout my life. For someone who's 
                        always wanted to be an artist/writer first, it's been slow going to find my place, and I've 
                        been helped so much by the encouragement of readers like you, thank you.
