<!-- <i>No one's calling it so I do, the announcement is saying stay here, but here the water is slowly coming up the window, we are almost horizontal.</i> -->
A grey ship extends from the asphalt downtown, its bow peaking into the low clouds, its sides turning and falling away at sharp angles. I could never go into it, 
only sit with my mother at the pond below, on the most special days she would take me with her to the edge of the water. 
<br><br>
I wondered often what she did when she left the pond, left the slowly circling ducks and rode the elevator to her office. I pictured her looking out a window 
into the fog. I could not understand why she left, as the people next to us kept throwing bread and the birds kept snapping it from the water, diving and flashing 
their feathers. 
<br><br>
Later they would find the ship had never been stable, that no one had ever bothered to learn the ballast calculations so the hull was always underfilled, tending 
to tip. It had always worked so far, the people like my mother coming in and going away, doing the calculations would only have showed how precarious it all was, 
hanging above the neighborhoods, the metal twisting in the wind at night.   
<br><br>
When my mother was late coming home I would start to cry. It wasn't fair she could go before I even knew her. I could feel that even when she was home she was often far away. 
<br><br>
I called her every afternoon to ask when she would be home, I can still remember her office phone number. This time she only said, <i>I'm afraid it will be a long day.</i>
<br><br>
I would learn the captain had been one of the first to escape, taking off his uniform so he wouldn't be recognized and stumbling into a liferaft in his underware. He 
clutched at the rescuers and never mentioned the hundreds he had left inside. There had been confusion on the bridge, a sharp turn had left the ship listing, but the 
ship intercom was broken. They couldn't speak to the people on board, so they played an automated message, the alarm sounded and said simply, 
<i>stay where you are.</i>
<br><br>
My mother spoke softly, <i>I cannot leave, they're telling me to stay.</i> I imagined the walls beginning to tilt, her windows turning dark with the swirling water. Everything 
going horizontal.  
<i>It must be an organized evacuation, </i>she said, <i>they're getting someone else first, then they'll come for me.</i>
<br><br>
The news began to report a rescue was underway, they made meeting points where we were supposed to reach our loved ones. Paper was stapled to the wall with lists of 
those who had been found, yet my mother had stopped picking up. 
<br><br>
People got on stage and assured us everything was fine, that everyone would return, but above their heads I could no longer see the outline of steel walls, the ship 
had fallen beneath the clouds. 
<br><br>
When I went back the street was blocked off, but I knew another way. The ducks had gone now, the oil colored water left still and lifeless. I sat and waited for 
something to appear from the fog, but the bank was silent. 
<br><br>
The captain was fired and tried, a new one was hired, work began on a new project downtown, to replace the old one. 
<br><br>
I would still call my mother's office phone in the evenings, she would pick up sometimes, though her voice was garbled and hard to hear. 
<br><br>
<i>When will you be back?</i> I asked. 
<br><br>
<i>Soon.</i> she said, <i>They just need me here a bit longer.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Haven't you already done enough for them?</i> It was getting harder to not be angry with her. I had stopped going into the city completely. 
<br><br>
<i>Oh Hunter, </i>she spoke so sadly, <i>I would love to watch the ducks with you, but I need to stay.</i>
<br><br>
<i>But these people don't care about you.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes, I know. </i> <i>But I care about you.</i>
<br><br>
I thought of her sitting in the dark, as the room had turned completely around and now faced downwards, waiting for the voice to change, to instead say, 
<i>It's time to go home.</i>

    Like music, a book can help you remember the way things were the last time you read it. I think I first read Paradise Rot my freshman year of college, 
    because I remember reading the scene with the mushroom in the bathtub the day we went to the plant store on Hawthorne. I was in-between, in-between being a 
    woman and something else, happy and not happy, I didn't feel satisfied that day but also tried to. I had no idea who I might be and so I laughed at my friend's 
    jokes and took a photo in front of the big leafy plants. I read Paradise Rot but wasn't understanding it, the words floated over me and I didn't notice the 
    narrator was really quite like me. I didn't notice that I was also walking around a new and strange place, that I also was beginning to desire a woman, that I 
    understood the book the way people around me might not. Was I queer then? Or did I become queer later? 
    <br><br>
    At that time I feel almost suburban about myself, I could have been mistaken for straight, and I did straight things. Reading Paradise Rot didn't even make me 
    question this, because it all felt obvious, reading and thinking this book is too simple. It's only now that I can understand the turns of the book, why J leaves, 
    why J becomes obsessed with Pym, why Carral comes to sleep with her. I also remember the other time I read it, when I was reading from the loft of the tiny house, 
    only a few feet below the wooden ceiling slats. That was a time when I was blank, waiting, I knew clearly that things were not right, not aligning, but not what to do. 
    So internally I often did nothing, numbed myself to my own thoughts, my dreams and intuition, my poetry disappeared and I read the book unfeeling — at least that's 
    what that time feels like now. I think I will like remembering this time of reading it; the tea, milk, mold, piss, drawing closer to my own strange life, beginning 
    to turn the ways I like. I hope that the memory of this time is tied to the places I go in secret, the concrete buildings hidden in parking lots. The view out the 
    window in the hallway, my favorite view, of the windows all spaced out along the neighboring building, some hung with lace which blows in the wind, a yellow-beige 
    wall which always feels like summer. A few windows are always condensing, wet from the people who have just showered. The wall reminds me of the video for  
    <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWujIbVofVg&ab_channel=Pitchfork" target="_self" >
        Harps</a>, the one where the lesbians go outside in the summer and collect sounds. The wall has many beautiful sounds, the light brushing of the lace curtains, insects 
    landing on the window sills and calling as they rub their wings.

<i>Berlin Saturday Night</i>
<br><br>
There's the couple across from me, one is holding a large camera and taking photos of the other while they sit on the couch.  
<br><br>
Watching as I pretend to read, I want to lean over and tell the woman she looks uptight and afraid. 
<br><br>
She leaves and comes back, looks at the photos, 
<br><br>
<i>I'm not sure what to say.</i>
<br><br>
I read a book about war, and as always I think about the silence that followed the shot, the smallest war but the one I was in. 
<br><br>
<i>I'm not sure what to do now.</i> She's always looking down at her hands. 
<br><br>
<i>Maybe chat with the new friends you brought?</i> The one with the lip piercing offers and her voice breaks a bit at the end. 
<br><br>
She keeps reaching for her, rubbing her back like it will keep her here, reaching her shaking hand to the thigh, the other body doesn't give.  
<br><br>
I ask myself again, like every morning when I brush my teeth, if you were meant to teach me to love myself the way I loved you? Am I any closer now? 
Alone but now with a bar through my tongue. 
<br><br>
She goes to chat with the new friends she brought, I watch the camera aiming, the clicking loud and rapid, the way she says I want you. 
<br><br>
Outside, the orange lights of a stopped truck illuminate a shape in the road, it could always be an animal.
