Cops come out of the woods with green eyes 
<br><br>
green lights on radios blink
<br><br>
you and I are walking from the many boxes beneath my bed

a body is reclining in a cardboard box 
<br><br>
head removed, but safe somewhere else,
<bR><br>
the body is yours 
<br><br>
It's hers, no 
<br><br>
It's yours 
<br><br>
It's mine.

On the stoop of the step 
<br><br>
trees graze the parking lot all night 
<br><br>
and this building also lends 
<br><br>
light to how many inside?
<br><br>
I'm falling apart in the hot sun 
<br><br>
No, I'm falling apart in the way the haze is 
<br><br>
painted on those houses miles out 
<br><br>
far below dusk, sinking far below my clock
<br><br>
I come into the silence 
<br><br>
of your slow breathing 
<br><br>
I spread across the entire world and wrap myself into a memory 
<br><br>
it was a road far away, 
<br><br>
the whir of the fan exposes 
<br><br>
the sound of the boxes beneath us 
<br><br>
your breath moves like the fan 
<br><br>
into me.

It was eating the whole world up. I found the processes of urbanization; destruction, exposure, exposure expanding. Insects formed the composition of birds, suddenly 
the prevalence of sap-feeding pests, insecticides, the prevalence of antibiotics, prevalence of pharmaceuticals, the presence of wild insects. 
<bR><br>
Massive declines, the proliferation of endosymbionts, gut flora, microbial fauna, 
<br><br>
Thousands of insect specimens can be processed, including extraction of DNA in hot alkaline. Nanopore sequencing, I submerged them for 10 days. The genetic barcodes just fell out. 
<br><br>
Economically important pests, through a partnership, a pipeline for the presorting would allow to remain fully intact, treatment, in which insects are injected with 
hot alkaline, 
<br><br>
Parsing the effects, may enter the environment, mirroring, I observed in dragonfly nymphs. 
<br><br>
Herbivorous scale insects on street trees, some bedbugs and presumably cockroaches, 
the viability of offspring was reduced, the flies were reared this led researchers to speculate. However, lab studies

At my high school awards ceremony I wore a white dress. It was long with small flowers and buttons running from the neck to the hem, 
<br><br>
beneath the dress was an unpleasant truth, my skin was like that of any animal, but I still walked to the stage and received my awards. 
<br><br>
My father liked to cover the world in gauze, through his frivolous visions, 
<br><br>
the pulsing house, but it isn't really, it's only the light caused by grey clouds. 
<br><br>
In the car, we stopped at the light adjacent to the Muckleshoot Casino and looked up at the moving billboard,
<br><br>
Aces spread out on a green felt table, then a fish hovered in a stream, waiting,
<br><br>
when pushed in the silence of the car ride I tried to finally say,
<br><br>
<i>you have only made me up, your conception of me is imagined.</i>
<br><br>
Under the fluorescent sign he said, 
<br><br><i>
I've always viewed you as a beautiful woman, and I'm not sure if I want that to change...</i>
<br><br>
We lived on a plateau and the sun would set. I went out with my mother to her car one night as she tried to get behind the wheel. 
<br><br>
If only her hands would work, they grasped the leather and she looked out the stationary windshield, as though it were the line of trees that blocked us, 
<br><br>
instead of me only saying, <i>you can't drive away,</i> meaning in her state, but she didn't try again.  
<br><br>
I pulled her by the wrist and leaned against the door of her room, holding the doorknob as she turned it slowly, 
<br><br>
inside the room, my father pretended to be sleeping, fish swam in the stream outside, all the while. 
<br><br>
There were in fact many men in the house. There were in fact many women in the house. 
<br><br>
If it had simply not been our stream but a stream, if it had not been our house but a house made by an animal, 
<br><br>
Often the craneflies in the attic went by unnoticed. They flew around the light from the TV downstairs, as he flicked through the news channels. 
<br><br>
I went alone to the stream and found frogs, I did not imagine them but instead watched to see what they did. 
<br><br>
He saw what he was told to see by his mother. I looked around and believed the stream could someday wash the house away.
