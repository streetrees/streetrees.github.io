     <i>Scaffolders outside the building 
    <br>smoke from 10 cigarettes 
    <br>they build a city they understand, 
    <br>I'm the one who doesn't.
    <br>what is the signal to begin? 
    <br><br>
    In the morning we fly out of nearby windows,
    <br>brick homes along the street
    <br>I write about things I don't understand, 
    <br>the things I do I stay quiet about.
    <br><br>
    I was raised by 
    <br>a man standing on the street in the early morning 
    <br>he's waiting for the truck 
    <br>barely speaking, only breathing.

I think often of wasted time. They took me to another part of the country and set me up in a hotel room. Another girl was my roommate, it felt strange to 
share a bed with a stranger, so we looked at the cow painting on the opposite wall, 
<br><br>
<i>It's ugly,</i> we said. 
<br><br>
We went down eat the Marriott breakfast. Some eggs and some orange juice. 
<br><br>
The cow painting looked down on us those two days, <i>I guess we're in Wisconsin,</i> we said. It's snout was only half drawn, the rest falling away into absent 
brushstrokes and circular grasses, I could hardly sleep as I wondered about running, how much pain would I be in? 
<br><br>
Another city far away, another cow painting but this time it's my own. I wonder who lay in bed those nights next to the other girl, whos slow breath coming in and out, 
<br><br>
I walk down the street a mile later, cars come late into the night and they look cartoonish, they are only black with yellow lights, yet I imagine them pink, green,
<br><br>
they seem to come forward and backward around the bend, the road bends as though it is drawn, signs for mattress sales and autobody shops, it's only Marzahn, it's 
only another language, I can read easier now, the sky around becomes known, 
<br><br>
It isn't Auburn anymore, it's a different street, but the trucks on the sidelines are the same, their engines pour fumes into the night, four lights keep watch in 
dim fog, 
<br><br>
I ran well, down in Wisconsin, I'm sure, I can't remember now, but we left anyway.

<i>
I dream you wrote a poem better than mine, 
<br>
it had words I hardly understood,
<br></i>
<br>
My father has a small hole behind his ear. I saw sometimes, a silver screw, 
he says it's from the day his father shot him, 
a misfire, he laughs, 
in the sunlight behind his ear the metal glints like jewelry. 
<br><br>
My father thinks of a woman with silver hair smoking on the beach, he's staring at the wall of his room and looking out from the bed, only his hands 
grab on the edge of the blanket, he peeps his little eyes out at mine, 
<br><br>
My father loves ceremonies, he thinks of the silver woman on the beach, swimsuit reflective, his drink cold enough with a single ice cube, he touches on 
the silver at the back of his head, he thinks, <i>because I haven't won anything yet,</i>
<br><br>
In his dream, the woman comes with a slip of paper, it sparkles above his bed, it lets him keep sleeping, 
<br><br>
light bounces around the bed, sparkling from the frame to his silver limbs.
<br><Br>
