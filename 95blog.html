My fantasy is taking you to play pool, taking you to the Pool Paradise (pronounced the German way) that's on the upper floor of the of the waste managment 
offices behind the combined car wash and auto parts store in the part of Berlin that reminds me most of Kent, Washington. In my fantasy we walk the whole 
way because in American fantasies there are no busses 
and when we get to the 'Shooters, Darts, Billiards' sign hanging 
crooked with the arrow pointing to nowhere you wonder where this is all coming from, 
<br><br>
and I don't tell you but this is just like the Eagles Club down the hill from the Muckleshoot 
Casino, the place falling apart on the side of the highway with white corrogated metal siding and many plywood 'additions' and the wood soaked black 
by this time and set in a giant asphalt lot where the Eagles parked their trailers and left their rain-stained awnings and barbeques out all year, 
and through the screen doors I would watch the old men in the trailer kitchens, looking out into the center of the lot and waiting, waiting until 
evening when they would go to the lodge and play the slots in the wood panelled hallway under the small plastic clock, 
<br><br>
and my dad used to play pool he said, with his buddy Greg, my dad used to smoke cigars, he says. I want to smoke a cigar with you in Pool Paradise, 
I want to be a contractor who plays pool with his buddy in the evenings. I want stop moving, I want to give up at Pool Paradise, I want to watch the 
sun rise over my trailer and think about where I will hang my framed prayer, I want to stare at the numbers on the slots and feel nothing.

A spring erupts, take me down to old ladies' basement back in 2007 where we found the conch laying on the bookshelf,
 you put it to your ear but there was no sound. A large lamp was standing in the corner, with crystals hanging from the shade, you need to 
 get rid of all this, they kept telling her, she couldn't make the steps, I never go down there, she kept saying, it was a cloudy March, ducks 
 swam in the pond outside my mom's office, we lived in Auburn then, buildings still grey, buildings and corperate parks, I walked through the 
 parking lot and came to the chain link fence, behind were the train tracks, once I hopped the fence and I found that the tracks only led 
 to another town, with another corperate park, at night streetlights shown in through the basement windows of the old ladies' house, 
 lighting up the crystals on the shade, I never go down there, she always said, while the lamp stood all night in the wood room reflecting the 
 shards of the streetlight, and noone saw, until morning when we found that the tracks only led to another town, and that through the night 
 everything had stayed the same.

<i>God Plays Tuesdays At A Bar In Waco</i>
<br><br>
His knee was pressed on the edge, his chest twisting towards me, movement that carried on to the bed and he was already there, 
his legs softened with brown 
hairs, and I feel the faint edge of his skin, air slides from his body like water, and it all feels thicker now,
darkness spread in smooth layers and heaped on us, certainty arrives like a current, he is seconds from me and I see the pores in his 
face, where the air coating us both is flowing into him, and I know, it is unmistakable,
<br><br>His words emerge in my skull like a spring, 'yes' 
<br>He takes my wrist, 
I feel the roughness of hands that made the wood beneath us, I give way.   
<br><br>
He leaves at 4:30, taking his glass of vodka from the table and stumbling out to the hallway, I lay in the darkness remembering 
his eyes on my skin, 
speaking with him through my mind, it is there that he tells me he loves me. 
<br><br>
Do we always need to give beauty back? Within weeks he is gone. Meeting God means learning that God can leave you.  
His face turns from mine 
and I watch the world warp around his back, the kitchen becoming concave as it hurtles towards him, he makes no mistakes, I see my life spreading 
down the dark hallway after him, sticky as black oil.   
<br><br>
'Look again' they tell me, I look and look at David Koresh, his face blends into everything I see, I examine him in every thought, he is more than the 
sun rising because he controls it, because through his words he showed me how to see, so everything is made of him. 'He is not God' they say,  
but they didn't see what I saw. 
<br><br>
I sit on the floor and listen, his words have already sounded within my mind before he speaks. His words are my own thoughts, have always been my thoughts, 
the rhythm has been with me my whole life, it is only that now it is being said back to me, he is my mirror. I look up at his face, shocking and clear as the 
world has blurred around him, I think to him, 'our thoughts are the same, how can you leave me?'  
<br><br>
He does not respond, only looks to the back of the room. I try and conceal my thoughts, I scatter them in pools so that he loses some, 
I never think the entire string, only a few words at a time, I layer 'I love you' louder and below ground I begin building. 
<br><br>
I watch the muscles twitch below his skin, his fingers releasing and sliding on the strings, he is silent now, but I can see his thoughts plainly, he is 
thinking of blue cattails. I don't tell him, but I have discovered a secret. 
<br><br>
I place him in the waving corn stalks and I slow the blur of the wind until his outline is no longer sharp against it, I make his body 
lay soft in the grass. In the room, I watch his lips form the words and I take them before he can speak, because they are also mine. In the shower, I pull my own 
body from the backdrop, my shoulders slipping through the air as it parts for my skin, 
<br><br>
The last time I see him, he is sitting on a stool in the center of the plywood room, his bare back curled and seeded with bones. 
He turns and looks up at me, thinking I'm stagnant and wooden as the wall, his eyes black flies and landing on only what he wants. I watch his world 
decay, because he thinks that he's alone.

A lot has happened this last week, some good, some strange, some probably bad but as stated on my spam: even the bad things lead to new perspectives 
which are always good. 
<br><br>
My goals for next week are: 
<br><br>
1. Spend time alone in my room, feel bored and maybe even some despair. Write about daemonic (cite: Goethe) presences (people and mists) in 
Berlin. Revisit crazy island while I'm actually quite sane and have wholesome, lonesome fun. 
<br><br>
2. See only people I like, which right now is three people and my roommates of course. I'm culling, I have spread my net but now it's time to check the 
catch, and I need to get my goddamn nets out of the water. 
<br><br>
3. Be both less embarrassing and also more cryptic, which counteract, i.e. poetry is embarrassing when it tries to make something simple into 
something cryptic, or when it tries to talk down to you, however I want to be cryptic in a non-embarrassing way: because if I just wrote down the things I 
knew that were right I'd have a scramble. Does that make sense? 
<br><br> 
I won't tell you about my last week because I was a different person on every day, and I'm trying to make sense of how I (the real me) feels about it. The 
most important thing going forward is that I learned to prepare fly soup: 
<br><br>
<i>Ingredients: Jar from the freezer of the 5th floor of the Museum Für Naturkunde Berlin, top shelf, marked 'berlin malaise trap 2021' should contain 
    a thick black sludge the consistency of a jar of capers. 
<br><br>
A. Pour jar contents into a tray, out will come thin ethanol then the first large bees, butterflies, wasps that have floated to the top, 
use a pipette and tweezers to spoon out the black mass below, spots of red compound eyes punctuating, each fly a unique sparkling and spotted bead, held 
together in a black sponge, spread liberally on the tray.  
<br><br>
B. Use tweezers to parse through the thick mat of flies, pull those of similar sizes and place head-down in individual vials, until you have a tray of 96 
separated flies. 
<br><br>
C. Extract the DNA and perform PCR (auxillary information found elsewhere)
<br><br>
D. Pour the remaining fly soup back into the jar and return to the freezer for tomorrow, don't forget to pick up the smallest specks and legs from the 
sides, they could also be flies. 
<br><br>
E. Think of nothing else. When your mind begins to wander, perhaps towards love, return it gently to the fly soup waiting for you in the freezer. Once you 
have finished the existing jar, pull another from the back up freezer, there are hundreds left.
