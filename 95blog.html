    My bag flies open in the wind. I think of the birthday we spent alone together, one cupcake on the floor between us, 
    and I thought you'd be disappointed, but you told me it was your favorite birthday you could remember. 
    <br><br>
    You saw me. You wrote about seeing me smiling and laughing, with butterfly clips in my hair, falling out, I was never a fantasy, I was myself. 
    <br><br>
    Something's stuck in me. I want to show you the songs I learned, I want to sit in chairs by the window at night, I want to play pool again but this time 
    I wouldn't forget anything,  
    <br><br>
    I can't get to work today, something's stuck in me. I want to be kind like you, I want to know like you. 
    <br><br>
    Of everything, you wrote about my smile. I don't know how to apologize. I don't know how to fix things.

I'm coming home for Christmas, the fields are cold outside my car window and I am alone, the sun is setting and soon the fields will be dark, 
molding orange to grey, 
<br><br>
Flies used to be like centipedes, but they fused their front legs to form a star, a padded tongue, a sponge, a syringe. Now the legs extend from the body and 
carry them nowhere, but in.      
<br><br>
A woman is screaming towards me on the train in Berlin, she runs to the engine and pounds on the glass, we couldn't see where the blood on her hands was coming from, 
tension rose while warm drops fell to the floor,   
<br><br>
But we pressed away from her, onto the walls instead, making the void where she was, making her turn and tunnel back into us.  
<br><br>
Come closer, was the fly afraid of it's new organ? As it pressed the bed of hair into fruit, this was the first year I found myself afraid that you would take something from me. 
<br><br>
I think I like you, I find myself 
wanting to take your spoon to my lips and press the metal into me, spinning from the sharp edge to the smooth 
center, I want the sharpness of your face to be my own. 
<br><br>
My classmate tells me everything in a poem sent from the airport, 
 <i>I want my eyes to darken, to dig in my face, to get bigger and resemble the deepness of yours.  </i>
<br><br>
It's exactly 
what I wanted, to be turned into the casing of someone else's body. I send him a letter about my mom, he responds with even more. 
<br><br>
I suddenly understand the secret, you, who first allowed me to see myself, you, who lives somewhere in the desert now. Within your disjointed body I 
saw my own.        
<br><br>
We surround the woman until she becomes our same temperature. We become hers.    
<br><br>
Last year, I lived in a city made of desire, the view outside my window was always cold and white, the white page and black letters on my screen bled into the 
walls and out the windows, absorbing into the concrete and becoming all I tasted, this year, I stop being afraid, I trade my hands for a mouth.

Dreamed that I'm in a hazing ritual, there's hundreds of us and we run and hide in different parts of my small town. Everyone looks familiar but I don't 
know anyone. The people in my group are whispering that they'll hurt us if they find us, I believe them but I'm still not worried. I keep moving until 
I'm at the top of the bleachers and I find my parents, my mom comments that it's strange they're using physical violence, we all nod but are still unconcerned. 
<br><br>
I'm hiding in a woodpile when I'm caught, the woman takes my arm and leads me to a man with a chop saw blade, <i>we're going to cut the tip of your finger off</i>, 
<br><br>
I break out of her grip and run past her, but stop at the door. She hasn't chased me, she's just watching, the other people who've been caught just wait in line, 
staring at me. I realize the tip of my finger is really not so bad, and I get back in line.

I pressed the net into the stream, I leaned forward with my body and held it under the water, 
<br><br>
I caught the dragonfly floating on the surface, it was limp, and full of water.  
<br><br>
Water had soaked into the windows in it's wings, it's body was loose on the center, it felt like beads.   
<br><br>
I laid it on the table and left, I didn't even watch, 
<br><br>
as it's body dried in the sun all day, 
<br><br>
and come evening, 
<br><br>
was alive again.

There is a bridge ahead of me through the fog, grey arch stretching over my street, like a hillside, maybe I am coming out of Berlin 
and entering a forest, it's only an overpass, or the side of a façade, a roofline so high above that it is also a bridge, I see both at once, seeing 
switches between; a house, a hillside, a bridge,
<br><br>
none are right.
