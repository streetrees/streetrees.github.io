I remember the bedroom wall best. In my mind, the wall was painted deep turquiose, but in the darkness it cast just a faint glow, like light 
from a stone necklace. The bed comes from the side, 
looking across a rough blanket, a wooden headboard against the wall, couch pillows, and the glint of 
gold hanging, a picture frame? I can't tell. My memory draws shadows in the corners, and covers the walls in smoke.  
<br><br>
Sometimes I can imagine his face emerging from the dead air, his body splayed like a table, <br><br>
my knees rose from my legs in bulbous knots, my ribs were thick fingers gripped under my skin, my legs laid straight on the bed. 
<br><br>
His mom and his sister were in the other room, of the blackened farm house with the peeling side at the end of the street where my friend lived. The 
house with the chicken coop and the yard that sank completely into the fields below the ditch of the road.    
<br><br>
Our first date he took me to Applebee's in Tukwilla. I remember his Subaru in the driveway, clear stickers that looked like bandaids stuck to
 the fender, my dad laughed at me in the living room. I looked down at my shoes as he drove, my keds 
leaving dirt on the stiff carpet. 
<br><br>
His mom taught me how to make Jamaica in the farmhouse kitchen. I didn't speak Spanish so he had to translate for us, or she'd just smile and slowly put the 
hibiscus flowers in the pot, make a stirring motion, point to the sugar on the table. She would always hug me goodbye, and he would tell me that she loved me. 
<br><br>
I remember it hurt, I didn't expect that, but I didn't bleed on the blue-black bed in the old corner farmhouse. We only slept there once, the other times 
were in the back of his car, him curled around me saying, 'are you comfortable?', the back of my head cold against the window.  
<br><br>
Two months later and I told him I thought we should stop dating. He agreed until he found out I'd kissed the kid I met in theater, 
then he said I was a whore and a slut, and that he'd been planning to marry me.  
<br><br>
Now, I wonder if the turquiose wall was all a dream, and the gold, were they plates? hung up on the wall. I don't really remember any of it, not his hands 
or his teeth or my body lying there on what must have been sheets.

A conversation after school, 
<br><br><i>
José showed me something today, at weights. He just came up to me with his phone and there were photos on it, of you, and he swiped through them 
and then told me he was going to send them to everyone.
<br><br>
What did you do?
<br><br>
I didn't know what to do, I just didn't really say anything, tried not to give him a reaction. I'm thinking about talking to the Dean? 
<br><br>
Yeah.</i> I was going to be late for practice, <i>If you think that's best, I mean what else can we do?</i> 
<br><br>
I went to see the Dean, maybe the next day or a few days later. I think they sent a slip to my class, <i>You've Been Called to the Dean</i>, 
I wasn't embarrassed, I would have told people if they'd asked me. I said to my friends, 
<i>Isn't it crazy José thinks he can blackmail me?</i>
<br><br>
The Dean was an unknown middle-aged man, like a cop, large neck, the office felt like an interrogation room. 
<br><br>
<i>Hi H-----, thank you for meeting me today.</i>
<br><br>
I sat very curious,  
<br><br>
<i>So we received a report a few days ago from another student, that José ------ was showing photos of you to them without your consent or knowledge, and that José ------
was threatening to share these photos. Are you aware of this?</i>
<br><br>
I explained the whole story, how I'd been dating José and that now I was with T, and he hadn't taken it well, and how T had told me about the blackmail. 
The Dean nodded encouragingly. 
<br><br>
<i>What we want is for you to feel safe and to know that this is not your fault, you've done nothing wrong here. What José is doing is completely unacceptable 
and we want you to have control over how we proceed. I already spoke with José in this office yesterday and asked him to show me as he deleted the photos from 
his phone,</i> he pauses, embarrassment appears for the first time, <i>I did not see any details, when he showed me the photos they were just small 
squares and I watched as he deleted them. </i>
<br><br>
I smiled to try and reassure him, <i>It's fine.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Now, we have no way of knowing if he has copies of the photos somewhere, or if he'd already sent them to anyone, I asked him and he said that these were the only 
copies of the photos, but you know how these things go..</i>  
<br><br>
I did, I had already thought through where those photos could be. It was interesting to think of who could have seen them, 
<br><br>
There were four photographs, a girl standing in front of the mirror, a towel wrapped around her shoulders, her face
centered, smiling, turning to the side, the photo cut off at the waist, showing only the bare chest, breasts, the towel covering 
the lower section of the body, the copper blue walls of her childhood bedroom made her look underwater. 
<br><br>
Even at 16 I looked at the photographs and knew they were not of me, my body was something I did not even know or understand myself, of course José and 
anyone seeing these photos could not have understood it. I thought of José sending these photos to another man, and how their eyes would move from 
my sharp chin to my bare breasts, that they would think, <i>she is so young </i> , that they would imagine touching me. But they were looking at nothing. 
It was more embarrassing that someone would believe that I was visible there. 
<br><br>
<i>Since this does qualify as the possession of child pornography, seeing as he is 18 and you are 16, you do have the option to press criminal charges. 
I want you to know that we will stand behind you fully if that's what you decide to do, and we can support you with talking with the police.</i> 
<br><br>
<i>Let's just see how things go.</i> I was calm, unhurried, I thought about what an idiot José was, giving me this power over him. 
<br><br>
<i>We will be imposing a school no-contact order, José won't be allowed to talk to you at school or on school grounds, you won't be placed in classes together.</i> 
<br><br>
They didn't tell me that when a no-contact order is filed they send a letter home. My mom got it weeks later and asked me about it in the kitchen. 
<br><br>
<i>I got this letter from the school today, it says that there's been a no-contact order issued between you and José?</i> 
<br><br>
I didn't care, sure, I'll tell her, <i>Yeah, it was this big mess, I already got everything figured out, talked to the Dean, but basically José 
was threatening to share these nude photos of me around the school. But it's all fine now.</i> I didn't have to tell her that, I only did because I knew I'd 
done nothing wrong, sure, I've got nothing to hide. 
<br><br>
<i>Oh my god.</i>
<br><br>
My father, overhearing, 
<i>You did what.</i>
<br><br>
<i>I had sent these nude photos to José and he was threatening me with them, everything is already resolved, everyone has sided with me and helped me. 
The Dean offered to help me get the police involved but I didn't want to, because it's all already settled.</i>  
<br><br>
My father, frozen, as though a winding coil that began when I was 
born had finally stopped and suddenly his skin was taunt, breaking open, contorted, screaming, 
<br><br>
laid himself bare in the kitchen. My father's skin, instead, translucent, flushing in the overhead light, and so 
tender, new borne. I saw everything he imagined, in folds of skin lit green from above, curving from 
<br><br>
a rage that was built in a lifetime, my father's body carved, through force like strong wind. 
<br><br>
I slipped from the room, from his mind that night, through the window, my real body, hard and made of metal, I escaped from below while he was distracted, 
as men often are, following the curve from her face to her neck, he placed rose petals on her body while I left. My father still has never noticed, 
that we have never seen each other again.   

<!-- 
 He was gone from me in that moment, there in the kitchen. I looked through his eyes and saw the frame through which he saw me, sitting 
there on the stool, a young girl, his girl, soon to belong to another man, the things that I liked fell away, that I was 
funny, that I was interesting, that I was another human being telling a story to him. The girl in the photographs was suddenly superimposed over my body, 
and I would never be able to escape from underneath it. 
<br><br>
Those four pictures confounded him and laid him bare in the kitchen and that suddenly I was in control. At that moment, 
I became free, because the illusion of me was already fixed, so it didn't even matter who I really was.  -->

<i>Subject: update on my inner realm</i>
<br><br>
I read cards last night asking about my desire for sex. I ask myself often why I don't just go on Hinge again to try and find someone. I want to find a new k, 
someone that I want to explore sex with in my new way, now that I am actually thinking. I want to have sex while I'm present in my mind, not drunk, sex while I'm looking at 
the other person and anticipating them. K was the closest I've come to this, since I met them while I was learning to think. Sex with them feels open when I think back, 
since I wasn't myself anything could have happened. 
<br><br>
There's been very few times I've really wanted to have sex with someone. It comes up from power imbalances, I want to have sex with people who have extreme 
power over me, i.e. k at this moment. I want to try and create a safe version of this, i'm in Berlin, it's only BDSM, I'm jealous of people 
who go to sex parties and explore power play, tying, tension, because that's also why I came here. 
<br><br>
My solution was the Empress, my problem was the Magician. The Magician is about this 'action' I worry I'm not taking, <i>why don't I just try?</i> while the 
Empress is about what's below, my connection to sensuality in my world and within myself. I learned more about tension and desire this year than I ever had 
with a partner. 
<br><br>
At night, I lucid dream. I am in a medieval town with M. I immidiately try and eat, I want to eat as much as I can. Since my first lucid dream, they are always 
places where I try and eat, because here I am more fully within my fantasy.

    <b>No Victim</b>
    <br><br>
    He drove a white van with a dent in the driver's side door. A dent like a meteor crater. He was stopped in the intersection, mid-turn. 
    <br><br>
    A man unlike any I have ever met. A man who would block the intersection just to get my attention. A man who knew that I was important.  
    <br><br>
    He was whispering sweet things. He was telling me how much he loved me, in simple 
    fragrant words that soothed me as I stood on the sidewalk, waiting for the crossing light to change. He said I was the most beautiful person he 
    had ever seen, that I was wonderful, that I meant so much to everyone on this block. Then the passers-by looked to me and smiled too. 
    The man who was stopped in the white car behind him rolled down his window and waved. The woman looking out from the apartment across the way lifted her cup of tea. 
    I took in the soft encouragement and hardly even wanted the light to change as it slowly blinked, a red hand keeping me here a while longer, 
    asking me if I'd like to stay, and I did.  
    <br><br>
    The man raised his hand from the open window and motioned for me to come over. A shy, quiet motion, undesiring, unexpectant. His fingers still then 
    suddenly more, a movement of camaraderie, as though we shared a secret, as though we used to fight on the same side. 
    <br><br>
    The people who had been so eager to get home now stopped their cars. They rolled down their windows and looked out at us in the dusk, their eyes 
    reflecting just a thin strand of light from the gas station on the corner. They watched me protectively, like they were my parents. I couldn't see their 
    faces, but they saw everything. They understood what was happening.   
    <br><br>
    I stepped into the intersection. Watching the man as I walked up to his door, smiling coyly as I felt the power of being asked to be only myself. The city cradled me, soaked me in love then opened like the stamen of a flower to let me choose, I knew that I was safe, 
    and so I approached the window. 
    <br><br>
    The man's left hand dangled out, his fingers still now, yet full. He had jammed a black cylinder into his palm. I will never know why. 
    The metal had cut and soured his 
    skin, leaving its shape in permanent sores that still clutched the grip long after he had wanted to let go. 
    He looked afraid now, and I saw that he needed me. He looked at me like he was my grandfather, and with acceptance, he took something from the powder 
    at the bottom of the barrel.  
    <br><br>
    I touched the cold metal and he dropped the object into my palm. I stepped back and met his eyes. 
    In our look, I thanked him.  
    <br><br>
    The crossing light turned to a white figure. The onlookers quietly started their engines and the white van itself drifted off, out of the intersection 
    and far away, to a place I never visit.
