<i>Meant to Be</i>
<br><br>
There was a time before we could have understood each other. But it wasn't to speak to me that you learned my language, and it wasn't to speak to 
you that I learned yours. 
<br><br>
I walk in heels down the street. I am going to print out my documents to tell the city that I have moved, although I really moved 10 months ago, 
I wasn't allowed to tell them until now. 
<br><br>
The structure of the city is a body, they say roads are arteries but they don't mention that the construction of the city dictates not only our world but also our 
dreams. It is the path of the streetlights that allows you to walk, it is the concrete overpass that blocks you. It is the building that allows you to climb the steps, 
and sleep a hundred feet above the ground. 
<br><br>
My friend tells me a friend of her cousin got the ameoba that falls into your contact lens solution and eats your optic nerve. The ameoba is largely 
untreatable and leads to total blindness, infecting 100 people in Germany each year. A few months ago my monthly contacts began to hurt my eyes and I switched to buying dailys, if I think about it, I can see faint black lines 
all over my vision, and the impressions of the things I've looked at, I blink and the lines remain. I am convinced that I too have the ameoba, and start to 
feel grateful when I notice I'm seeing, <i>look at the street and the buildings, you are not blind, you soon will be blind, enjoy seeing her face, at any moment 
    you won't be able to see it any more.</i> 
<br><br>
I want to go to the eye doctor to ask them if I have the ameoba, and get glasses, but my health insurance refuses to send me my insurance card, until the city 
can tell them that I have moved. I learned in the Kafka museum that Kafka worked in an office writing workplace safety protocols, i.e. 
examining how the tool impacts the body, what happens when the body works within the greater body of the city? How does the city carve the body? 
<br><br>
I went back to watching court TV, in this trial the accused becomes obsessed with the character <i>Dexter</i> and decides to become a serial killer, 
he justifies the killing by deciding that he is an agent of fate. That were he to kill successfully it would be correct because the universe allowed it. 
This strikes me because I also tend 
towards this logic, <i>if something happens it was meant to be</i>. 
<br><br>
One night k and I both wore a black turtleneck to our date, everything was going wrong. I wanted to be with them so badly but they were 
apathetic and distant from me. Instead of sleeping together we sat together in bed and started talking about free will, I pointed out that we wouldn't be 
acting like condesending assholes if we both weren't wearing black turtlenecks. Then things were okay and we kissed and I asked if they thought we were 
meant to meet. <i>I don't think that way</i> they said, <i>I think people construct their own reality</i>, 
<br><br>
<i>yeah, I'm not a dumbass. But it can be nice to think that things are going to turn out alright.</i> 
<br><br>
and they didn't.

<i>The body complicates things, perhaps a bit like the war, which spread your friends across the continent, or your mother's addiction, the unconcious 
    body lying next to you in the grass, I think of my own mother's addiction, to not understand the order of things, of love, the order of love, hearing me and 
    responding, when this is disturbed, it complicates things, turns life into a new game, I too wish you were only a bright light, and that I was the tall, thin 
    body of a streetlight, curving above the strange world, and most alive in your absence, but complication brings us much more, the elaborate movement 
    of DNA replication, would you ever prefer a world where nothing moved?

    green glass bottle <br>

    I'd wake to find <br>
    you missing 
    <br><br>
    slippers on tile <br>
    shoulders bent over <br>
    I knew from your voice <br>
    when you'd crossed over 
    <br><br>
    I always wondered <br>
    what did you find <br>
    in that place <br>
    away from your mind 
    <br><br>
    or was it <br>
    you only wanted to speak <br>
    feel for my skin <br>
    and say that you loved me 
    <br><br>
    but all those mornings <br>
    you'd wake and see <br>
    all of your words <br>
    were only a dream 
    <br><br>
    we closed our eyes <br>
    the house turned dark <br>
    the walls bent forward <br>
    to help you up <br><br>

    now you're back <br>
    but I've already seen <br>
    a world that you <br>
    could not believe

<br><br>
The table is pulled too close to my chair and my eyes are too close to my microwaved rice, making the salt crystals more visible than I've ever noticed, and 
of course the rice still looks like meal worms. I eat very slowly and think about if I was really eating meal worms, that it doesn't really bother me to think about, 
the rice still tastes the same. 
<br><br>
Days after receiving it, I cry thinking about this text in my phone: 
<br><br>
'I'm here'<br>
'Very busy'<br>
'But waiting to see you!!'
<br><br>
<i>Waiting to see you, I won't leave before seeing you, I want to see you before I leave, I'd like to see you, seeing you would be nice for me, I'd feel good 
    seeing you, I enjoy being with you, I won't leave yet, seeing you makes me feel nice, I like you.</i>
<br><br>
I cry and cry, I cry at the same spot I always cry walking home from my S-bahn stop. The spot at the bottom of the hill where the road begins to even out and 
I can see the other people walking towards me, they always hold their kids' hand and smile, then I start to cry. 
<br><br>
I feel mostly numb, numb is most of my feeling. I realized this last month that I wasn't in love with anyone, not even my partner, not even the person who I've been 
sad about, that actually I feel almost completely numb, like the nerves are burnt out, or I'm in a padded suit, that I'm really afraid of that soft of thing, 
<br><br>
This makes me cry a lot because I didn't really think it was happening. I felt it changing of course but I didn't really think it was true, I thought it was 
just kind of funny, like how in movies people say, <i>I'm afraid to get hurt again</i> but that's kind of a ridiculous thing to feel. 
<br><br>
I can't turn towards anyone, only away. Things that used to seem nice now seem scary, like sitting across from someone at a dinner table. Like looking at someone. 
Like liking the 
look of someone. 
<br><br><i>
That sort of thing, I think I'm afraid of that sort of thing, I deeply want, that sort of thing, I think I'm afraid, of that sort of thing.  </i>

<br><br>
I was getting used to seeing your skin, I looked through the doorway at you standing in the kitchen, looked secretly at your back and your chest, 
desire in an unconcious way, that everything was tense, it was your stomach that I wanted, wanted to scrape my fingers across the 
skin, wanted to see your body move under light as though it were mine. 
<br><br>
I leave a faraway train station late at night and there is movement in the divider between the roads, cars speed around the dirt clearing under the bending trees 
and within there is movement. Many rabbits chasing each other by the tails, many rabbits running in circles in the space between 
the roads. They are black circling feathers, the clearing ringed in the self storage building lit all white and the speeding cars, red light 
threading out in rods and crossing the meadow.
<br><br>
You admit you masterbated in the middle of the day yesterday, you never masterbate, you say, and the cum was mixed with blood. I think about you masterbating 
in my house, on my couch, the same way I did that afternoon, that perhaps we want to touch each other.

You tell me this late at night, before you leave, and I think of the reasons you would rather touch your own body than mine. I think of the reasons I am afraid 
to move my hand to your stomach, that no matter what the desire will remain, that we are so uneven, a body alive and a body wishing to become the other, 
that no matter what you feel, I don't desire myself and thinking through you, I cannot move.

<i>At night, Seowon goes back to the lab to watch the anenomes alone.</i>
<br><br>
We call Seowon from the beach and we hear her voice break on the phone, 
we hear the crack of glass as she hurries, turning off the microscope light and taking the soft flowers 
from her pools of salt water, 
their arms pulling in and the barbs slipping down, her fingers, wet and smooth like theirs, shoving open the steel door
and soon 
she is running, her skirt to her ankles and rippled with sequins, shaking and crashing around her knees, 
the ocean body has laid down beneath the stars, a dark desert before us, we wait before the water, 
waiting to hear her steps down the bank, and her breathing coming, sandals loose on rocks, she dreams of   
glowing water, wet, soft, teeth of the anenomes, all turned blue in a light eminating from within, 
the sea lit with embedded stars, mirrors all around, she feels dizzy, and then she is with us, reaching our silhouettes on the beach, we envelope her 
but she cannot breathe, <i><br><br> Have you seen it?
<br><br>
We urge, <i>yes,</i> we have seen it, the water remains only a velvet covered bed, one could walk on it's belly, the soft back of a cat, 
one can slip into it's wet mouth, 
<br><br>
Seowon is walking into the water with her skirt, the fabric melts into the black velvet, 
I step into the water too and follow behind up to my knees, she turns from me 
and swings her hand through the water, 
the noctiluca erupt, her arms fly up, her hands to her face, covering her mouth still turned from me, 
her 
body turned out to the water, she breaks towards the horizon, where we cannot see, only hear, her sobs as the beads of the algae light her legs, carried 
in the water to her skin, globes she has seen but never spoken to, as they hold her in their world, and light it so that she can see.
