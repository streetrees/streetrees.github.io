Is hating myself a strength? 
<br><br>
I turn off the Miles Davis and begin building. Below ground, I begin building. I wrote that once, so I can't write it again. 
<br><br>
There's lots of things to say, some about the <i>Riviera Apartments</i>, those apartments on the side of the highway I'm always on about,
set back in a teardrop cul-de-sac, row-like, low roofs and sharp doors with silver numbers that shone on sunny days as I drove past, sixteen and always busy,
 sun lighting up the tan sheet walls catching on the windows and staying insects between the panes, but the real show was at night, streetlights strung 
 down the lot, light beads, round bodies that created the Riviera Apartments in the wet darkness, each night like that, clicking heels on the 
 sidewalk, I rolled down my window to listen, but what did I know then? 
 <br><br>
I write about streetlights the way Bukowski writes about legs. When I drink, the next morning my piss smells sweet. 
<br><br>
What did I know then? Pretty girl I guess, she set up the camera to pose like a girl under an umbrella, maybe people will like me then, she 
thought, and the photo looked very serene, her umbrella tilted back and her looking up at what might have been rain.  
<br><br>
Can we be honest for a moment? I struggle to speak, I sit in the chair at my friend's house (I'm cat sitting) and begin to write fervently, 
the night before we are sitting around the table and the hands (aren't they really needles?) of the clock stop, 'your clock has stopped' Seowon 
points out, 'it always does that', an hour later Seowon screams as the hands run forward on their own, slipping down from twelve to three, I had 
said I thought about things like fractals, but I don't really know, I stopped talking somewhere back and was only listening, I said, 'that's really 
really scary' Seowon looked right at me and said 'Oh, you don't look real anymore', then I didn't. The room becomes plastic, words do things. 
<br><br>
I hope I don't know myself, like back then when I held up that silly umbrella. Because right now there's a lot of hatred, I really can't catch a break. 
'What's going on with me?' I think, and try and talk to you but just start wondering what the point of speaking is, like asking 'do you believe in God?' 
we now all agree it's all in our head, that's queer thinking, so I start to wonder about talking, if I'm never conveying information except for a recipe 
once in a while, or telling you to get away from me, but what else do I know? 
<br><br>
So what about the <i>Riviera Apartments</i>? I told you about them because I used to wonder if I would live there one day, twenty minutes from my parents house 
and off the highway outside Seattle, near grey-green parks with salmon in the streams, nobody ever got my obsession with the Riviera Apartments but my small hands 
on the steering wheel liked to pass by, only to wonder about 'someday', the place I am now, a strange house made up with words floor-to-ceiling, words I placed, they 
didn't come to me in color unnamed like back then, somewhere I started searching for words and then my vision became constructed, 'words do things', I scream at the 
clock which is no longer real, only placed near the window by my mind, superimposed on the dark vision of those old apartments, my vision includes all of it, maybe 
this is something you understand? 
<br><br>
<i>
' why don't you love me? I have to ask, how can you not love me? and it comes to this, ruby red narcissism, why don't you love me? I ask myself again and 
    again as my blood moves through young veins, as my body opens for you as my skin collapses, as my scab pulls apart and you are inside, within me, only 
    in my memory, keep me in your skin and eat mine, let me be crazy, what is more human? my mouth is held wrong, askew, melted like a meadow, hold me like 
    she reached for the crocodile in the florida stream, don't you believe I can be something? you doubt me and I see it in your body language of your soft 
    touch like morning light on blinds, open me, yes, I'm embarassing, yes, I'm stupid, yes, why don't you love me? I ask over and over to the glass beads, 
    why don't you hold me, sweet beauty? snow holds the mountains and my lips hold my teeth, speak in my ear, love my walk, how do you approach me? like fingers 
    tapping, like my p's and b's (always mixed), why do we speak if not to tell ourselves in the sugar carriage of the words that we are alive? come down and I 
    see you behind me in the mirror, what if I drank every night, hated myself every night, spoke to myself every night? and you, an imagined version of course 
    because you could never be so beautiful, and neither could I. I guess, I wake, you put your hand on my belly and there is hate there, tell me it's alright, 
    because you did love me in the end. '
