<i>Barriers</i>
<br><br>
Yesterday I think I gave myself a chemical burn on my hands. I was just cutting some labels at work and I realized that the skin on my fingers was peeling, a small 
strip on my other hand was white and dewing looking, I thought of all the 
lab disaster videos I watch on YT, that the acid (once activated) would continue to peel my skin forever, until my entire hand and arm were covered in these small 
openings of red wounds, 
<br><br>
I went to the back room and washed my hands with dishsoap, the peeling stopped and my hands have already mostly healed, but the strange thing was my indignation, 
only <b>I</b> get to cause slow, irreparable harm to my body through many tiny wounds inflicted daily and randomly, <b>not</b> you! The irony of my instant fear 
at seeing the small peeling at the tips of my fingers, relative to my complete apathy towards my difficulty with eating dinner the last few weeks, was..illuminating. 
<br><br>
From my notebook: 
<br><br>
<i>
The thing is, I know it's bullshit. I know I can't even think straight, I know I'll never be good, I know I'll never have what I want. Because I don't understand 
what I really am, somehow I think I have to be better, but how can that happen when I'm only ever capable of this? I can only write about my own shock 
at my own inadequacyâ€”what do you mean you don't want me? What do you mean I'm not good? As if I could delude them, as if I could pretend forever. The thing is, 
I'm so bad at everything I do, I'm delusional to think that someone would love me, would love what I think or write, these meaningless thoughts that are as easy to 
create as sitting or standing, but yet I say to myself that I'm a writer, that it means something, that someone will love me for saying it, and of course they 
never will, because the whole premise is flawed, I'm not an artist, artists make things that are good.
<br><br>
To Bri:
<br><br>
    If I heard you say those things, I'd wrap you in my arms and know that you were wrong, I'd know that of course I loved you, of course 
    you are good, I'd take you to eat and tell you that I wanted you to live, that I wanted you in the world with me, that I never wanted to stop hearing 
    your voice, that every room was better if you were there, that we should have never parted, I'd tell you to please stay where I can always hear you, 
    <br><br>
</i>
I woke up this morning thinking of my favorite line from Ron Silliman's <i>Sunset Debris</i>: <i><br><br>
If we lie on the mattress in the closed-off old back porch at 90 degree angles, your legs lifted so that, lying on my side, I enter from behind, the fingertips of 
my right hand stroking your clitoris, and we go about this slowly, almost lazily, does it make for better understanding?
</i>
<br><br>
This line occurs to me daily, I enter from behind. What do I enter from behind? I enter a room from behind, I enter the world from behind, I lie awake in 
my bed at 8 am and wish that instead of getting up to get ready for work my barrier was broken, I am tired of my barrier, I understand the need for it, 
one cannot be entered without being separated, but it is also part of the building of the barrier to resent it, a room wants to be entered, otherwise why 
was it built?

<i>Sunday in Berlin</i>
<br><br>
I found a special place today, it was a meadow with a
junkyard running down one 
side, with cars stacked on top of each other held out from the wall on hooks, bright little cars with their doors open and 
the leather seats open to the flies and the morning dew, there was no sound but my steps as I crushed the grass, and an animal ahead of me once, that I never saw. 
<br><br>
After the junkyard was a mountain of broken concrete, perhaps remnants of old buildings like the ones I could still see out in the city, places like this make 
me think of what I like to imagine is over the horizon, a marina like the one in the book my mom used to read to me, with grey buildings and a storm always 
coming in, or a place where streetlights continue towards the horizon forever, and the sky always stays pink as you walk farther, as the lights turn on above you, 
one-by-one, 
<br><br>
I was happy to find the meadow but I didn't have much to think about, only things about you, but I can think those anywhere. So I 
walked back through the tall grass and went home. Of course, I thought about what it would be like to take someone there, but I don't think they'd like it 
very much, and I don't think they'd see it the way I did, probably because we all go to very different places in dreams, 
<br><br>
The other special place I found this week was the opening of an old building on a street in Mitte, when you stood outside the doorway you could smell the 
molding wood and wet insulation inside, and the damp cold poured out so that it felt like I was in the building, though I was only on the sidewalk, everything 
was condemned, and waiting for collapse, and I thought of the trailer I tore apart to make my old house, the layers of a house that smell also like a body when 
they decay, 
<br><br>
This week I dreamed of a house on a hill far away, in the dream it was my grandmother's house, and on the table were cream eggs in silver stands, I looked at my 
egg and then out at the trees which spun and thrashed outside in the wind, the kitchen was delicate, my grandmother had run her fingers down each ridge of the wainscoting, 
sanding the edges and smoothing the paint until there was nothing but her touch left in the wood, she had crafted wooden accents to the corners of the room, which 
made the room feel like a picture frame, 
<br><br>
I asked my grandmother what I should do when I felt sad and she knelt and took the egg which was also my skin, in the rain, the house disintegrated, leaving 
me to only imagine what she might say.

I want to tell you about this winter, am I finally on the other side? Can I say something about it now?
<br><br>
To be insane in Berlin, I listened to the album I used to listen to then, alone on the subway, alone and always alone, 
<br><br>
What I remember is leaving your apartment and walking up the steps to Yorckstrasse, it was always cold, 
<br><br>
I force it, because I don't know if I can say anything about that yet, the person standing on the train platform so distant from me, 
the sun closing over the buildings, the ring bahn taking me around and around, I never knew where I was, every face looked like yours, or adjacent, 
or opposed, everything in relation to you, the center of my world your apartment, there was always snow on the ground and it felt like your touch, there 
was always ice on the road and you'd tell me not to slip, walking was hard without you,
<br><br>
The city didn't make sense to me, I was waking in a dream world, it was always cold, I walked the streets next to my apartment at night, there was an orange 
glow and the windows of the other buildings didn't seem to belong to anyone, I never spoke to anyone but you, 
<br><br>
Let's talk about Christmas, I've never had a Christmas, I was only born this February, before that there was only the Christmases my mom got drunk 
and drove us home, and fucking on your parent's couch, your mom turning to me during Home Alone 2 and telling me she has depression, maybe I was really in love with her? 
Throwing up in an alley outside your high school reunion, I wish I could have been hotter in front of the kids who bullied you,  
<br><br>
You hugged me once before I got on the ring bahn, because you knew that it would never take me home, <br><br> 
I hope you never touch me again.

The oldest lie I still believe about my body is that I have control over it, 
<br> <br>
I eat and my body is built, my body is built from decisions, my body is a bag of food, my body is a bag of time. 
<br>
When I stop eating my body takes itself apart from the inside, 
<br>
<br>Actually, the mirror creates my body, my body is a shell cobbled from what's around me, 
the thoughts I have, when I eat the food disappears within me and only my DNA is reflected in my skin, and the space taken up by my shoulders 
is filled with your own assumptions of my linearity, of how I spend my time, of what I've done. 
<br><br>
Bones are alive, what can you tell from bones? What can you tell from my body? There is no effect from something as simple as food, I wish there was, 
I come thinking of the simplicity of this, control and release in one, in the body, they are always the same action. 
<br><br>
It is the middle of the night and I can't sleep, it is dead summer and I feel like a child in my parent's house, with the fan turning in the night by 
the window, I am alone, like then, with a mind and a body that have changed but keep the memory, history is a body created by judgement, my body's history 
is made of judgement.

Maybe people are also like drugs. It's all stimulus, and I think we all know people are like drugs without even having to say it.

<i>Someone tells me they like me, they aren't you. 
    <br>
    Someone tells me they like the words I use, they aren't you. 
    <br>
    I sit alone, I want to be held by you and only you. 
    <br>
    I want to fall apart, I want to be in pieces. 
    <br>
    Where are you? Why aren't you with me? 
    <br>
    Why couldn't you like me? 
    <br>
    Why didn't you understand me?

There are two reactions to food, the first is bodily, my cells taking the food apart and incorperating it into me, taking the proteins to rebuild my DNA and the carbohydrates to move my muscles and the fat to lie beneath my skin, creating the shape of my body in space, and the shape which you see me. The person you see is a collection of the food I have eaten only transmutated through many systems, many ways of counting and carrying which continue to build me whether I ask to be built or not, were I to want these processes to stop I would need to stop the source, and let them begin to take the scaffolding apart instead.
<br><br>
There is a second reaction to food, the cultural and imaginary. I had my first lucid dream when I was in second grade, I was on a deserted island surrounded by fruits and I could taste the sweetness as though I was awake, so I ate as much as I could, the sweetness perfectly recreated in my mind, and in the dream my body grew and became fat but I knew that it was all imaginary, and when I woke up everything would be the same. My most memorable orgasms happen in dreams, the reaction building and climaxing and I know that it is imaginary, and actually when I wake up, nothing will have changed. Things are better imaginary, or in dreams, where there are no consequences. I eat and change my body and yet the next day you see me the same. But imagine if the dream were real, if I would eat in the real world and my cells and my body transform, and you would see my actions reflected in my body, and know what I had done.
<br><br>
Imagine if you were with me when I climaxed and saw it and remembered it, and saw me from a vantage point I can not control. Even masturbating is much worse than coming in a dream, because my body cannot change when I want, I cannot make myself any shape, and afterwards the real world changes.
<br><br>
I would rather suck on mints for sweetness, things that leave no trace towards you, and hide the release of eating in dreams where you cannot see it, the place where my body shifts and molds easily and there is no delayed, prolonged reaction, aging, as I take in what has happened, and show it all to you.
