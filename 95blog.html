<i>
    Like music, a book can help you remember the way things were the last time you read it. I think I first read Paradise Rot my freshman year of college, 
    because I remember reading the scene with the mushroom in the bathtub the day we went to the plant store on Hawthorne. I was in-between, in-between being a 
    woman and something else, happy and not happy, I didn't feel satisfied that day but also tried to. I had no idea who I might be and so I laughed at my friend's 
    jokes and took a photo in front of the big leafy plants. I read Paradise Rot but wasn't understanding it, the words floated over me and I didn't notice the 
    narrator was really quite like me. I didn't notice that I was also walking around a new and strange place, that I also was beginning to desire a woman, that I 
    understood the book the way people around me might not. Was I queer then? Or did I become queer later? 
    <br><br>
    At that time I feel almost suburban about myself, I could have been mistaken for straight, and I did straight things. Reading Paradise Rot didn't even make me 
    question this, because it all felt obvious, reading and thinking this book is too simple. It's only now that I can understand the turns of the book, why J leaves, 
    why J becomes obsessed with Pym, why Carral comes to sleep with her. I also remember the other time I read it, when I was reading from the loft of the tiny house, 
    only a few feet below the wooden ceiling slats. That was a time when I was blank, waiting, I knew clearly that things were not right, not aligning, but not what to do. 
    So internally I often did nothing, numbed myself to my own thoughts, my dreams and intuition, my poetry disappeared and I read the book unfeeling â€” at least that's 
    what that time feels like now. I think I will like remembering this time of reading it; the tea, milk, mold, piss, drawing closer to my own strange life, beginning 
    to turn the ways I like. I hope that the memory of this time is tied to the places I go in secret, the concrete buildings hidden in parking lots. The view out the 
    window in the hallway, my favorite view, of the windows all spaced out along the neighboring building, some hung with lace which blows in the wind, a yellow-beige 
    wall which always feels like summer. A few windows are always condensing, wet from the people who have just showered. The wall reminds me of the video for  
    <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWujIbVofVg&ab_channel=Pitchfork" target="_self" >
        Harps</a>, the one where the lesbians go outside in the summer and collect sounds. The wall has many beautiful sounds, the light brushing of the lace curtains, insects 
    landing on the window sills and calling as they rub their wings.

<i>Berlin Saturday Night</i>
<br><br>
There's the couple across from me, one is holding a large camera and taking photos of the other while they sit on the couch.  
<br><br>
Watching as I pretend to read, I want to lean over and tell the woman she looks uptight and afraid. 
<br><br>
She leaves and comes back, looks at the photos, 
<br><br>
<i>I'm not sure what to say.</i>
<br><br>
I read a book about war, and as always I think about the silence that followed the shot, the smallest war but the one I was in. 
<br><br>
<i>I'm not sure what to do now.</i> She's always looking down at her hands. 
<br><br>
<i>Maybe chat with the new friends you brought?</i> The one with the lip piercing offers and her voice breaks a bit at the end. 
<br><br>
She keeps reaching for her, rubbing her back like it will keep her here, reaching her shaking hand to the thigh, the other body doesn't give.  
<br><br>
I ask myself again, like every morning when I brush my teeth, if you were meant to teach me to love myself the way I loved you? Am I any closer now? 
Alone but now with a bar through my tongue. 
<br><br>
She goes to chat with the new friends she brought, I watch the camera aiming, the clicking loud and rapid, the way she says I want you. 
<br><br>
Outside, the orange lights of a stopped truck illuminate a shape in the road, it could always be an animal.
