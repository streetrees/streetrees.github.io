<i>Goodbye For Now</i>
<br><br>
I was getting used to seeing your skin, I looked through the doorway at you standing in the kitchen, looked secretly at your back and your chest, 
desire in an unconcious way, that everything was tense, it was your stomach that I wanted, wanted to scrape my fingers across the 
skin, wanted to see your body move under light as though it were mine. 
<br><br>
I leave a faraway train station late at night and there is movement in the divider between the roads, cars speed around the dirt clearing under the bending trees 
and within there is movement. Many rabbits chasing each other by the tails, many rabbits running in circles in the space between 
the roads. They are black circling feathers, the clearing ringed in the self storage building lit all white and the speeding cars, red light 
threading out in rods and crossing the meadow.
<br><br>
You admit you masterbated in the middle of the day yesterday, you never masterbate, you say, and the cum was mixed with blood. I think about you masterbating 
in my house, on my couch, the same way I did that afternoon, that perhaps we want to touch each other. 
<br><br>
You tell me this late at night, before you leave, and I think of the reasons you would rather touch your own body than mine. I think of the reasons I am afraid 
to move my hand to your stomach, that no matter what the desire will remain, that we are so uneven, a body alive and a body wishing to become the other, 
that no matter what you feel, I don't desire myself and thinking through you, I cannot move.

<i>At night, Seowon goes back to the lab to watch the anenomes alone.</i>
<br><br>
We call Seowon from the beach and we hear her voice break on the phone, 
we hear the crack of glass as she hurries, turning off the microscope light and taking the soft flowers 
from her pools of salt water, 
their arms pulling in and the barbs slipping down, her fingers, wet and smooth like theirs, shoving open the steel door
and soon 
she is running, her skirt to her ankles and rippled with sequins, shaking and crashing around her knees, 
the ocean body has laid down beneath the stars, a dark desert before us, we wait before the water, 
waiting to hear her steps down the bank, and her breathing coming, sandals loose on rocks, she dreams of   
glowing water, wet, soft, teeth of the anenomes, all turned blue in a light eminating from within, 
the sea lit with embedded stars, mirrors all around, she feels dizzy, and then she is with us, reaching our silhouettes on the beach, we envelope her 
but she cannot breathe, <i><br><br> Have you seen it?
<br><br>
We urge, <i>yes,</i> we have seen it, the water remains only a velvet covered bed, one could walk on it's belly, the soft back of a cat, 
one can slip into it's wet mouth, 
<br><br>
Seowon is walking into the water with her skirt, the fabric melts into the black velvet, 
I step into the water too and follow behind up to my knees, she turns from me 
and swings her hand through the water, 
the noctiluca erupt, her arms fly up, her hands to her face, covering her mouth still turned from me, 
her 
body turned out to the water, she breaks towards the horizon, where we cannot see, only hear, her sobs as the beads of the algae light her legs, carried 
in the water to her skin, globes she has seen but never spoken to, as they hold her in their world, and light it so that she can see.
