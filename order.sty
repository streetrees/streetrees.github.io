<i>Then</i>

when will the street begin
that they did, that you did 
A vision inside of a laboratory, 

Why am I leaving so late? 
I'd ended up at
little dirt trails but at one edge was a chain link fence

and of course that night I wasn't there 
you extract something real then 

plastic the water tumbling 
wake, the sweet steel beneath 


<i>Transition</i>

when I was in 2nd grade, I was
lots and lots, but who matters?
or to tell the teacher you understand 
  

outside a body, within the lanes of the track 
in the lines of your hand when you start to wonder what has changed 

I get confused in the order of things 
A conversation I remembered through each person was mostly a stranger to me
we are sitting next to a tree next to 
the sound 
and look where we came out, see 
spitting loudly, couple with white 
spiraled, laying with right shoulder on
to have that done, another thing to read 

I put on my socks or get into bed
I live in the house in my head

stimulus and response lightened me
when I decided to be alone


<i>Now</i>
 
behind the lake it does not move 
you became only a shape which I met
at night, a light shown into the basement windows

that you saw me. I'd like to be more 
biting down and opening the mouth

vibrant, I won't listen to the fear  
want, I don't understand what 
I'm a writer, that I'm actually 
to sleep, to feel it all again


<i>Mom</i>

you always go to sleep too quickly
you were taking me somewhere else, somewhere I feel now

how do you approach me 
it coexists with what you want 

let me slip past your hands and hold you tenderly
you might be able to hear that I am also crying with you

my disappearing skin that I am in 

it was actually funny because she 
really would not be mad if I 

need? can it really all be

<i>Dad</i>

I see your disgust, placed back into me 
slower, I release your intensity 

two existing bases were combined 
so off balance, even beautiful 
she reached for the crocodile in the florida creek
like me, why did I mess everything 
of course I can't even say it
I lie 
lets move on 

giddy up, I get on the 
my body transform, and you would see 
dreams where you cannot see it, the place 
within the barbed wire it's still just woods, under his gaze I'm still me 

mine, a distance you maintain
fish mouth to the surface, gasping 
spoke to different people 
other in code 
through thoughts instead of through the hand 
now, ones I think I made 
the food apart and incorperating 

<i>Love</i>

that sweet joy, of feeling you taking
the base of the receding glacier, that she wanted us to bury her
yesterday, that maybe it's time to send a letter 
a cold that I remember and through it's soft voice 
control in the purest way, through perception 
behind my back, why am I thinking of you? 




leaning back in your chair beneath the grand paintings in your office 
 
Just like I have no other life separated by an entire ocean 
the people simply speak, grass grows, and I go back home. 
I wish I could invent a hundred new words which equate to 'intimacy' 
you stop and sit in silence 
 
the surprise I'll never forget of realizing adults could ask such things 

at the end of my perfect day my dad comes to pick me up 
right now if you want to see me you have to meet me in an imaginary world 

each word certain as it is spoken 
would look down at the water in summer 


wind and the rain soaked 
tonight you get relief from crying 
but at least now I know the importance of honesty 
when we played games in the hayloft, did I think I'd someday feel the same,
 
shipwreck be the microcosm, variety
leave my skin leaking 
this was during the best vacation we ever took 
 
I think of the nights my mother cried 
stimulus and response lightened me 
slower, I release your intensity
which by the way, 

precise and minute spines of radiolarians 

and have it be like we never met 


instead of the truth, that the mirror on my wall 
there is no effect from something 
I eat child's food because if I make it too complicated I don't trust myself to eat 

gaze doesn't work for my devastating 
matter, I have the rain and the

world with me, that I never wanted
