How do you approach me?<br>
it coexists with what you want <br>
<br>
You stop and sit in silence, <br>
to have that done, another thing to read. <br>
<br>
I put on my socks or get into bed <br>
I live in the house in my head <br>
<br>
When I was in 2nd grade, I was <br>
lots and lots, but who matters? <br>
to tell the teacher you understand.<br>
<br>
Outside a body, within the lanes of the track, <br>
in the lines of your hand when you start to wonder what has changed. <br>
<br>
I get confused in the order of things <br>
A conversation I remembered through each person was mostly a stranger to me <br>
we are sitting next to a tree next to <br>
the sound <br>
and look where we came out, see <br>
a vision inside of a laboratory. <br>
<br>
When will the street begin? <br>
I'd ended up at <br>
little dirt trails but at one edge was a chain link fence <br>
and of course, that night I wasn't there. <br>
<br>
plastic, the water tumbling <br>
wake, the sweet steel beneath <br>
behind the lake it does not move <br>
you became only a shape which I met <br>
<br>
at night, a light shown into the basement windows <br>
<br>
So off balance, even beautiful <br>
she reached for the crocodile in the Florida creek <br>
like me, why did I mess everything <br>
of course I can't even say it <br>
I lie <br>
Letâ€™s move on <br>
giddy up, I get on the <br>
my body transform, and you would see <br>
dreams where you cannot see it, the place <br>
within the barbed wire is still just woods, under his gaze I'm still me
