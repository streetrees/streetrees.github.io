slippers on tile 
shoulders bent over 
I knew from your voice 
when you'd crossed over 

I quietly slip out
fish could slip through

slip past your hands
slip from the building across the way
slipped from the room, from his mind that night,


slipping down from twelve to three

slip on sneakers leaving dirt

We cannot slip through, with our hands clenched so tight
               
vibration slipping down the line
their arms pulling in and the barbs slipping

you'd tell me not to slip,
I think they sent a slip
in the snow my tires would slip


slip into it's wet mouth
slip my own hands behind my back,
slip my hand down the skin like a knife in butter,
slip in black masses over the ground 
slip over land while we cannot see
slip ourselves under what we believe is their skin and try to empathize

slipping through the air as it parts for my skin
slipping a paddle into the water.
slipped through the pages
slipped in my socks and slammed my head into the corner of the wall
