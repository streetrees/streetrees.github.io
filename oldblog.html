when I went to you in the cold night
<br>frantic there at your bedside,
<br>thinking this might be the time 
<br>for you want to take my hand 
<br>
<br>you didn't even switch the light 
<br>just looked out with tired eyes 
<br>to tired to see the desperate cry 
<br>ruptured after all those years 
<br>
<br>when I was set to leave our home 
<br>hoping you might help me go 
<br>hoping I'd hear on broken roads 
<br>you finally say the way to go  
<br>
<br>you spoke so quiet I might not hear 
<br>so I buckled and came near
<br>But you only turned and as you left 
<br>all you said was I knew best 
<br>
<br>you wanted a family 
<br>and only built a grand silence 
<br>beautiful table set with linens 
<br>still bright white with absence 
<br>
<br>I think about what could have been 
<br>for me to want to call
<br>wonder what you could have done 
<br>for me to want to fix it all.

        <br><br>
        Tonight I was thinking about this post, thinking about how I should probably erase it or perhaps add more to it, like how C never loved me but 
        probably would have loved you, or maybe something about my dad but right then a rat fell out of my ceiling, chewed right through the trim boards 
        and jumped down onto my bed and then ran around as I screamed and then the rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) crawled onto my foot and 
        looked up at me with unfeeling little eyes that were completely devoid of anything but the desire for the cat food I keep in the kitchen cabinet 
        and then the rat spoke and it said 'hey, shut the fuck up' and then I realized that I still have homework to do and then we talked about the 
        weather and the rat tucked me into bed and now I don't feel as bad.

<br><br> Saw you on the street today. You crept up and stared unmistakable in sharp skin, your face was like a perfect pale triangle that 
reflected my surprise, my horror, 
<br><br> I wanna be there when you touch fire, to be there for the inevitable fall, stop striding past me on the street, you evoke a spider, its unbecoming.

Whats the difference between the vision today and you? Whats the harm in choosing the dream within a dream, I'd rather see you every morning.

I should be asleep (it's 12:18) so we're ignoring that it's halloween for the moment,
<br> I think things are improving, I still have so much to do, but at least I'm beginning to dream about what's ahead 
once I get out from under all of these classes. I can see myself being able to write for pleasure again, and maybe 
even starting my other goals on my dream board, the moments I do have for thinking about the things I love feel so important and precious, I'm thinking 
of an obscure Fuller quote about Boccaccio writing the Decameron, if that helps  
<br><br>
I see a vision of my mother in our family trailer, I see the windows behind her letting a cool light in half shut blinds, I see 
her sillhouetted there in front of this aluminum grid and the perfect sharp angles remind me of a fingernail on metal and I grit 
my teeth. I don't see her turn but I see the light come in like that behind her and I could cry, I could cry now and let 
the emotion from my chest but I won't, I'd rather hold on to the feeling and use it later, use it over 
and over again to remember my mom in front of the cool morning blinds, I'd rather return again and again and prick this 
feeling with the morning light surrounding her head as she remains blacked out in shadow, a figure I couldn't place 
unless I designed this moment, a moment that could come to me again any morning, since it never came at all. More and less 
than a memory. Cool half shut blinds and the cranking space heater and warm rays of morning.

It's so early in the evening to feel this way, to need to face these anxieties head-on, to need to cope in some (any) way. Finding 
a way to cope is difficult this early in the evening. You can't smoke a cigarette (I quit), you can't drink coffee (why stay 
up more than I have to?), you can't drink alcohol (), 
<br><br>
I went for a walk around the neighborhood. The problem with this time of evening (7 pm on a Saturday night, late October,
Portland, OR 97202, cloudy) is that everything looks so completely as you would expect it to. You cannot see through the 
well-lit car parks and stately clean and cheaply made suburban homes in any meaningful or enriching way, you can only walk 
through the road as it was designed to be walked, as though you were walking your pomeranian after work. You can't even 
pretend that there might be something worth saying beneath these swollen black trees, because you can see them clearly, 
and there isnt. 
<br><br>
Last night I dreamed that I was looking in my full-length mirror. In retrospect, I should learn to use the floor-length mirror 
as a dream check, like how they used to say that about "checking-your-watch" when people wore watches. I was looking in the 
full-length mirror and my skin extended from the usual outline of my body, at first forming thin spikes not unlike the 
tendrils of a sea anenome above my waist, then morphing into a line of protruding pustules as though those gum tree 
seed pods were lodged beneath the skin and softly floating away. The pustules extended up my torso on the left side and down 
my left arm, I rationalized the condition as some sort of virus and continued about my dream, 
<br><br>
Today I bought a chest binder. I think that's really all there is to say about that. 
<br><br>
I feel bored, but not in the 'things are too great right now I sure hope they don't go wrong!!' sort of way, more like 
'I feel that things are deeply not as they should be and fear that my life is not at the correct heading, furthermore 
I don't have the time or more-so <b>ability</b> to fix it'. I feel bored in the, nothing feels right sense, I feel like 
I just explained that. 
<br><br>
I wish that I could scurry under the neighboring parked car and roll around in the mud, I wish that I could stay that way 
all night and get cold and shiver and feel sticky and then when they came out to go to the sunday brunch grandma hosts I 
would creep out and stretch like a cat and snarl, all for fun of course, and then I'd just never speak to anyone again. That's 
how I think I might fix things.

I'm seeing in a dissioso haze, today I'm in Portland. 
<br>walking down Sandy, moving towards what distruction? moving towards many people rubbing their wings together, it's unseasonably warm for this time of year. 
<br><br> My partner just left: what does it mean to be alone in the world for a few hours? I can smoke the last half of my cigarette in the full moon light 
(why is it so goddamn warm outside?) What does it mean to die if living long is just outliving all your friends? A mayfly life is just as long as mine 
if you think of it like that. 
<br><br>What does it mean to be healthy? If smoking a cigarette brings clarity, if I just like it, if telomeres degrade in the sun and we all still love warm weather.  
<br>
Portland is like a soup, Portland is like a stick in the mud. Have you ever thought about those Metric lyrics, <i>everybody else just arrived, ate their complimentary 
shrimp cocktail, and left </i> 
<br>what am I seeing and not seeing in this city? Where is the underbelly and how do I swim down to it, why are there some things 
that I just can't reach, and why is it so much more me to fail?

It's been so long since my last entry, is this how things will go from now on? 
<br><br>
I've been feeling stressed out, and sad, and overwhelmed, and brow beaten. I wish that I could rejuvinate myself a bit and recapture some of the 
happy feelings I had a few months ago. But sadly, all I have right now is restricting food and hating getting dressed. 
<br><br>
I think I'm in a strange spot right now with getting help- since I know that it will be good for me, yet also feel that it would be better to just 
fade away into slowly getting worse and worse, never righting myself and instead floating into a deeply unhappy and painful life. It's funny that I can 
care so much about doing right be my career/my job yet putting effort into my actual personal happiness doesn't seem like the right path right now. 
<br><br>
CONTINUED: SEPTEMBER 30. 2022
<br><br>
Wow please don't read into that. I think I need to focus on finding happy things during the day that will cheer me up. My anxiety subsides when I realize I actually 
have good friends and a good life here...
<br>the problem arises when I have so many things to do that I feel guilty for favoring fun things. Whatever, I'll make do. Really whats 
got me in a tizzy right now is this terrible feeling that I'm not going to get back to Germany, merged with this weird dislike of my parents (weird because 
they haven't really done anything wrong lately, I just feel this desire to never speak to them again...some say ED's revert us back to childlike states...or 
maybe it's just all that stuff we never talked about)
<br><br>
M is moving into his new apartment today. I've almost finished Lolita. I find this entry funny because it's straight to the facts, happy/sad we do not 
mince words here, or provide any further detail, things are what they are.

One of my favorite Fujiya and Miyagi songs, <i>Lightbulbs</i>, also the name of their second studio album- scathingly reviewed 
in Pitchfork (deservedly)- includes this chorus:
<br><br><i>
If today is the same as yesterday
<br>Tomorrow will be the same as today
</i><br><br>
I thought of these lyrics today because <i>Prairie Style</i> by C.S. Giscombe just arrived in the mail for me and I was pleased to 
see the same sentiment written there:
<br><br><i>
    Pleasure has its locales and gateways but tomorrow's just inevitable, tomorrow's the same as today.
</i><br><br>
Tomorrow's the same as today, tomorrow's the same as today. These words play in my head often- I find their contradiction 
comforting. The classic, 'and the sun also rises' and so on- since I am almost always desiring for tomorrow to be 
different, to be better, for me to make the right choices instead of the wrong ones, and yet. We live as though 
tomorrow will always be the same as today, we take steps that don't matter in no particular direction at all, today 
I made blackberry jam and watched a YT video about Dave Chappelle, and how exactly is that supposed to change tomorrow? 
<br><br>
One thing that occurred to me today is that I am getting better at deciding my day. I'm not sure when all of you 
fine readers learned this skill but it has only come to me in the last year, the realization that I can 
decide my own activities (beyond martial arts on Mondays and Wednesdays). I'm sure this is a end-of-college thing, 'so you're in the workforce now- what will you do with it?!'
I realized this summer that life is about teeing yourself up, creating the daily structures that will implicitly 
and subconciously shape the person that you are. This is the function of a parent, to create the structure 
    (the metaphorical tomato cage) until we learn to make it ourselves. The problem was that until recently I was still 
    using the old wire, trying to bend it to fit new goals, directions and a view of myself that I am sure my parents 
    had not imagined. 
<br><br>
The problem is that at present, I have given myself time but not yet filled it with structure, so I am floating. 
I find myself hesitating to reestablish my goals, perhaps because although I felt comfortable deciding I did not 
like my old direction, I haven't yet felt confident in a new one. I found my old vision board under my bed 
last week, I'd accomplished almost everything on it. Fucking river.

Yesterday I put on my low-rise blue jeans that I bought in Germany. I've worn them successfully twice, but lately I've been putting them 
on and quickly taking them off in favor of something, anything, more comfortable. Maybe it's the stiffness of the material, 
but I really know that it's the low-rise anxiety that comes from seeing nothing cover the space below my belly button (a word I 
do not believe I have ever had the courage to write or say. but 'navel'? even worse). Yesterday I was in such a hurry to undo them that I ripped off most 
of my fingernail and now feel a twinge of pain with every letter that I type with my right hand, there's a metaphor there I think. 
<br><br>
I read my cards with A yesterday, a lovely endeavor that culminated in a surprisingly cohesive spread- I'm always amazed that 
unlike astrology, tarot seems to become more reliable the more that I read, instead of starting to contradict itself once I make the 
mistake of consulting my local paper and costar on the same day. I pulled the two of pentacles for my past: apt since I actually did 
pull this card for my present the last time I read, and found solace in it (a butterfly (read:moth) balancing graceful 
change upon their wings). My present this time was the high priestess: acknoledge the shadows that your intuition is pointing you 
towards. Was it lame of me to say my shadows were just the many unanswered emails in my inbox? yes. But I think there is truth there. 
I left the team in order to have time, and what the fuck am I doing with it now that I have it? being sick? starting my car with 
a screwdriver? My intuition drove me here, now isn't the time for me to stop listening. My future was the son of cups, a card I've 
been pulling regularly - as if replacing my old friend, the ever-in-his-father's-shadow son of swords. The son of cups is sweet, 
creative, emotional and carrying dark intensity - and I know I just shit on astrology but, scorpio anyone?

                    Lately I've been feeling like a kid at summer camp - when the pines give way to the matted trails that turn in switch backs 
                    cold in the dusk up to orange lit mountains. I've been feeling like the moment the family car has dissapeared around the bend 
                    and the turn of the gravel has softened into the chirping of crickets in the grass. When the counselor who looks a bit lost themselves 
                    motions for me to head towards the cabins, seeing the wintered wood slumped against the hillside and feeling the imperminance of it all. 
                    I stare at the mound of familiar clothes I've strewn across the stained mattress and stand heavy in the empty room, see how 
                    many seconds I can count on my plastic watch before it is time to move on, on and on rings the dinner bell. 
                    <br><br>
                    I see you while I eat my sloppy joe. We've never met but I recognize you as my tether, my distraction from my ever-slowing watch. 
                    Outside the mess hall night runs her fingers through the glass and smiles that soon I will be on that old stray mattress - listening 
                    to the fan turn back and forth.

Perhaps this entry should not exist - perhaps this should stay in my head 
<br><br>
I wonder about the meaning of a blog - really I'm only writing to B now, as I'm guessing most of the other 
quiet listeners have disappeared after my month-long hiatus (I was traveling, you get it)
<br><br>
My blog is for displaying my writing in some ways, but mostly it's just my diary - and at times those goals 
are counter intuitive. Today I need to write in order to make sense of this, so I'm sorry that it won't be good, 
or interesting, or worthwhile, but writers write- and I'm not ashamed to make a mess of things 
<br><br>
I left the team this week. It's still painful to say that - it feels as though I might cry most of the day now. 
I don't know if it was the right decision, or if it was motivated by anxiety, the monster around me all the time. 
I'm afraid to be bad, I noticed this on the first day. Usually I assume that I am going to be bad, but that I will 
perhaps be good, but that should I be bad this year, it is overwhelmingly okay. This year was not that way, I felt that 
should I be bad, I would be laughed at, I would be looked at as a failure, as the idiot drunk who ran away to ignore 
their responsibilites and take a summer off, and now look - it catches up to you. I felt that the second I made a 
mistake, I would prove them right. So I couldn't even try, there was no room for that. 
<br><br>
Now T is doing well, she's doing great this year. And I'm jealous. I'm mad, I feel like there is no space for me left, 
there is nobody who believes in me now, who wants me to succeed, only those that want me to fail. Even when I want 
to keep going, when I want to finish at the real end of the road - instead of here in this strange patch of overgrown 
grass that feels forgotten and lonely and as though I never should have taken that exit. I feel as though I'm letting 
them win, when I know I'm only making myself lose. That trying and failing to take back what stupid acheivement I 
have deluded myself into thinking I want (just for my awful coach to be wrong about me) will not be worth my time. I can 
justify that I am leaving to focus on the things that I love, not the things that make me want to scream - it's just 
the fear that creeps in, saying I'm only leaving because I can't take losing. 
<br><br>
I think I'm leaving for many reasons, likely more that I haven't come to terms with yet. If I am leaving because 
I don't want to be ridiculed, doesn't that point to a problem in itself? I no longer feel safe here, it is no longer 
safe for me to be bad, because the person who would have told me that was okay, given me space and permission, is gone. 
I wish I could give permission to myself, because that would be the only way for me to step forward, to rejoin, was knowing 
that when I most definitely fail, it is okay. But isn't there more that I could strive for? Instead of convincing myself 
that I am okay with failing, what if I could try and be good in the things that I care about? There is uncharted ground 
ahead, ground that I can be happy on. The problem is now, the space before I can escape back to Germany and feel like myself 
again, the space where I have to convince myself that life is okay, is moving, where I know that I do not fit. The space where 
I'm lashing about, trying to escape back to the happiness that was so close only a few months before, and seeing it so clearly on everyone 
else. Things are so painful all the time, I only wish I could rest for a while.

Here we are : one month has passed since my last entry. And where am I now? 
<br><br>
I wish that I could live in the west texas desert painted up so right 'n pretty by Natalie Diaz 
<br><a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://poets.org/poem/if-i-should-come-upon-your-house-lonely-west-texas-desert" target="_self"><i>(for those who 
    haven't visited it yet)
</i></a>
<br><br>
The point is that there is a lot of pain out there. And in here, how every strike of the clock on the mantle brings stronger 
loneliness and sadness into us. Like how I still think of that old boyfriend (really acquaintance) when I read this poem, 
<br><br>
Or how I think about the frat party I went to in Boulder (who among us hasn't said those words?) 
I remember the loneliness of the cavernous rooms, stonework and columns in faux greecian facades and all the 
people drinking who I did not know. I think about sitting on the couch as I waited for my roommate to collect me, the lights 
dim white on the quartz countertop and old cartoons someone had turned on played on loop over the TV, mesmerizing me. 
The stretching black cat ran with the mallet in his gloved fingers as the VCR below flashed <i>NO SIGNAL</i> in 
green LCD letters and I lost track of the voices and the people and the comings and goings. The room felt like the 
loneliest place I had ever been. 
<br><br>
I know I said I was done grieving that ol' cowboy, but it's been reopened since now I won't be seeing him 
every week - so I think I'll allow myself a bit of heartache. But who among us can write "glow-throbbing" and get 
away with it? Certainly not me. If I ride the night any more for you D, I'll break it.

When I got overwhelmed yesterday I thought about plum creek. Plum creek is a colloquial name for the was-empty lot a few miles 
down from my grandma and parents' property in Cle Elum. My experience with the lot came mostly in the form of 
my dad taking me to look for 
elk and deer there in the late evening. The best part of plum creek was the white work truck that had been abandoned before I 
was born. It had decals for plumbing or something that were slowly fading and ripping from the sides - and I always dreamed 
of going through the cracked windshield to find what I assumed would be the driver's bones. The truck sat out in a ragged patch of 
grass and bleached whiter and whiter each summer. I think I always assumed it had had some sort of 
higher purpose as a plum delivery vehicle, due to the stickiness of the name plum creek in my psyche.  
<br><br>
When children's youtube sensation 
<a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://blippi.com/pages/who-is-blippi-stevin-john-actor" target="_self">Blippi</a>
bought plum creek last year to transform it into some childrens-carnvial-commercial-extravaganza, I asked my dad if 
the truck was gone. My dad seemed surprised that this would be my first question, but yes, the truck was long gone. I haven't been 
back to see the empty lot now.
<br><br>
I got overwhelmed because I'm in the falling action now - and I need to make sure all my loose ends are tied up. With others,
with myself, with my fucking homework. I think it was good to think about plum creek and that truck sitting there 
year after year. It must have been so quiet, sitting in the grass among the pine trees and watching the seasons change. 
It must have been so nice to have been loved by me, to have been valued simply for being there to waste away, impacting me 
just by being something I found beautiful. I wonder if impact needs to be so complicated? Or is being there year after year in 
subtle beauty enough for us?

<br><br>
As soon as M and I got off the bus to walk to this museum we both had the feeling of getting-to-the-campground. 
like: end of the gravel road, get out, 'okay, let's set up the tent!'
I thought it was the pine trees until I realized it was probably the smell of the nearby forest fire 
wafting smoke over us - this should have been foreshadowing.

<b>Teufelsberg</b>
<br><br>
We visited an abandoned US military base now completely covered in murals and found-object sculptures. We begrudgingly paid 8â‚¬ at the 
gate, assuming by the ramshackled signs hung around the fence 
that this would be an over-priced roadside attraction type thing. Then after a strange interlude through the military museum (army 
tank models and rusted peach cans obviously put together by the single veteran staff member watching from behind the bar in his motorized 
wheelchair) we came around the corner and saw the enormity of it. The faded and torn towers erupting from the layers of brick 
and concrete, every surface painted, a maze of eyes, faces and words. Everything was open, everything could be climbed, the surrounding 
woods were filled with shacks, tree houses and rebar structures in various stages of abandonment. The old foundation of one building 
was flooded halfway high with swamp water, duckweed floating through the concrete doorways. We climbed to the top of the tower and 
watched the sun set through the wind-torn canvas orbs, I have never been to a place like it.

<b>Teufelssee</b>
<br><br>
We walked down to the lake as the sun dropped under the horizon and the veteran and his young lacky kicked us out of Teufelsberg. 
Another couple was following behind us as we made our way through the woods. In the halflight we heard snorting in the brush 
and startled a herd of wild boar grazing on roots near the trail. I looked back at the couple and asked 'are they dangerous?'
the woman had eyes as wide as mine and said 'I think so', luckily as we stood still the pigs crashed in the brush and out of sight. 
<br><br>
We sat by the lake as the fish bit bugs from the water and watched the last light fade from the tower on the hill above us. M 
said if he lived here he would come to this lake all the time and just sit in the shadow of the 
cracking towers, looking like pure apocalypse on the horizon. A woman dove 
into the water and swam to the floating dock. I said 'boy, I sure wonder why it's called Devil's Lake?' - 
<br><br>
At dark, we set off through the woods for the bus station - about 20 minutes walk. 
As we reached the turn off from the road to the dirt path we heard rustling and snorting from the bushes. I am not ashamed to say 
that I was terrified. Boars were completely blocking the path we needed to take, invisible in the brush and crashing around us. We had no choice but to continue blindly down the road, moving to the middle as we heard boars moving 
along both sides. The forest road had no streetlights (and my phone had died long before) - In Alaska they tell you to talk 
while you hike so that you don't startle the bears, so M and I tried to keep talking  - eventually just repeating each other 
as we became too afraid to think of new things to say. As we stopped for the third time to wait for the boars to settle
M pointed at a street sign and said I should climb it 
and hold on if they charged. The road was completely deserted but for three cars that we tried to flag down, of which only one stopped. 
Neither of us had ever hitchhiked but there was no question about whether we should try it - when the man in the Audi stopped 
and asked where we wanted to go we said 'please just take us out of here', he seemed to understand our desperation but said that he 
needed to go up the road and would be back for us in 5 minutes. I don't know if he ever returned because I heard squealing in the 
distance and we kept walking.

Yesterday shifted things, it's funny that sometimes you know when a day is going to be important, and other times you just 
wake up and find yourself crying at the public pool. The lifeguard telling me to put my shirt on wasn't the surprising part, 
what was surprising was the man I'd played volleyball with earlier coming up to ask if I was alright as I cried small child 
tears in the arms of my friends. I still don't know what he saw when he saw me coming towards him- walking dejectedly 
through the green grass, tears coming down my face and my nipple piercing still sparkling in the hot sun. I wonder if he 
saw a topless woman crying- <b>OR</b> had he recognized something earlier in the way I moved my free body 
through the air? had he noticed my hestitancy when the ball flew high and I raised my arms, bare of straps and 
began rewiring the muscles on my chest. I wonder if he came to play volleyball with me because he 
wanted me to feel normal, that my body was normal here, like his, and with the casual offer of a ball over the net 
he was trying to tell me that I was welcome. I wonder if he saw the fall then, the sad walk back to womanhood- was he 
hurt too? at seeing how close I had been?
<br><br>
Later that same day I began to cry soft tears at the thought of my mother. A smart someone once told me that the way to 
tell if you are depressed is if you stop feeling better when you cry. Yesterday I felt better. Sometimes M and I have 
it out about my mother, and it's the times that I feel most healed by a partner. He says:
<br><br>
<i>What happened to you makes me so sad, you didn't deserve any of it. What happened to you was so unfair, 
    and somehow you have only ever put good into the world. I love you because all you want to do is to give 
    love to others. 
</i>
<br><br>
This morning M and I are at a coffee shop together as I write this, he is reading <i>More Than Two</i> and interupts me to show me a
 passage he highlighted, it says one must show courage in a poly relationship and be brave in the face of uncomfortable experiences. 
 He says, I want to work on this with you. 
 <br><br>
 Last night, I woke up at an unusual hour when the apartment was dark and all I could see was M's silhouette as he sat facing 
 away from me on the bed. He got up and I heard him drinking water in the way you do after you forget 
 to drink water on a night out. I realxed and started to fall 
 back asleep. Then he yelled and I heard a crash in the bathroom. I got up and asked if he was okay, with no response I opened 
 the bathroom and saw him laying completely facedown partially in the shower, unconcious. I woke him up and sat with him on the 
 side of the shower until he tried to stand and fell down again, complete dead weight in my arms. He threw up and I had to leave to 
 stand in the open window, trying to convince myself that the outside air was cold and fresh when it felt stagnant on my body. 
 M is fine now, but I have become so attuned to these changes in our lives punctuated by the fluctuations of our bodies. The reality of 
 the brain shunting blood away and the aftermath of blood flowing back, of picking up where we left off but a little more unsteady 
 every time. Aging and feeling the control slipping, making us pull up on the reigns, or perhaps begin to let go too. Who are we 
 when we remember that we are corporeal? Sometimes I can't even say 'body' because it makes me cry.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
<br><br>
Today I realized that I will be leaving this country. I can't delude myself anymore that I'll 
somehow have enough time to do everything. In calculating the next few weeks suddenly my flight home was there on my calendar - the end. 
I think I'll need to seriously compartmentalize in the weeks after I get home, because really there is no way I am going to be able 
to handle this re-understanding of myself. Here, I can just forget the incongruence between what I now want and my old life- but at 
home I will be living completely in the routine that I have now outgrown. I think it will be best to just play the game for the next 
year until I can muscle my way back to Germany - but I can also imagine a breakdown creeping up on the horizon. When in doubt, 
repress repress repress. 
<br><br>
I've been trying to write a short story but I've been overly critical of myself and keep stagnating. I want it to be a lovely 
little light-hearted ditty about summer camp but I'm completely overthinking it. I lack focus and direction (as is often the 
critism of my poetry) and I'm struggling to find the right tone or - write anything cohesive at all. I'm on the verge of scrapping 
the whole thing and switching to an erotic C fan fiction (me as nervous kid with glasses / C as captain of the cheer squad) just 
to feel joy in writing 'prose' again. I wonder sometimes if writing something is really always better than writing nothing? I'm sorry 
that this blog entry is such a let down, thanks for your attention anyway. I thought you might be interested to read the 
poem that M has kept in his phone case since I wrote it freshman year of college, I remember that he has it every year or so and 
ask to read it again- I think it's funny that he's kept it close to him for so long when it's not in any way 
a love poem. I think it does fit with 
my thesis here though somehow, but maybe just to show I've actually never cared for narrative focus.

A few things have been going on lately - one is that I got one of the songs from Metric's new album stuck in my head (success!) and 
most of my thoughts have had the faint backdrop of formentera the last few days. 
<br><br>
Another is that my feelings and emotions have steeled into 8-inch thick plates not dissimilar to the steel painstakingly welded to 
killdozer by MY metaphorical Ted Kaczynski - Marvin Heemeyer. At the risk of having this blog shut down by order of decree - I will 
refrain from saying my hero. Actually I have moments of feeling, but only of good. My body has shuttered itself to the pain of 
the reality of the world I am facing and has instead latched onto the happiness of small moments, soaking in them in a quiet 
and unhurried private trance. It is not good, and it is not bad, things just are. Perhaps what I'm saying is that I'm fantastically 
in the moment, much to the frustration of those around me - who may wish me to think of what will happen AFTER 
I have welded myself into a metal-sheathed bulldozer. And I am trying, but I fear that I have never done this properly,
this being completely within each second, until right now. And though I am at present pulverizing the city hall and getting my 
left tread stuck in the foundation ditch, at last - my anxiety has gone. 
<br><br>
It is easy to think that things are uncomplicated when you are someone like me. What can truly go wrong when you are a young white 
woman living in Europe with a loving and supportive family? I like to write on my computer because the words are superimposed 
onto my reflection in the screen, and I must constantly be reminded how those around are seeing me. You feel like a killdozer? Well 
you look like the gay kid drawing anime eyes in their paper margins. 
<br><br>
Much good has happened here on this hollowed ground, like the place near where the old ship is docked that always makes me think of 
C. When I was depressed I thought that everyone I met was saying the same thing, every thought in my head rang stale and tired and 
I could not understand what I was supposed to be doing all the time. These last months everyone around me sounds like a philospher. 
Every text that I get reads like Plato, every small motion of your fingers looks meaningful. Yesterday on the bus two people 
sat down at the same time and it occured to me that they were dancing. When people speak to me now I capture their words like 
those fleeting mayflies and eye them carefully until I see the beauty in the threads of the wings. I've become rabid for connection.
When I am with others I am at last, not thinking of myself.

When does a trip start and end? The last photo for the scrapbook was already taken, but we are not yet home. 
<br><br>
I am prodding you, we are at the beach which is really a lake- and the seaweed is freaking me out. We are speaking as the closest 
friends that have ever been. You speak like me, you think like me. Again we say the old jokes, I know all the music you like and 
still I'm prodding you, move farther please. Be more like me please. 
<br><br>
Two men are at the pole far out in the water, they are playing in the seaweed. You say that is like you and your boyfriend, I know 
that you mean me but it still hasn't felt natural yet. I drink my second beer and swat at the horseflies on my legs, I'm prodding 
more, maybe now you'll see it and say the magic words. When you are pushed too far we reroute like water, the heron is catching a fish.

I am both within my head and within yours. And every time I feel as though I'll never be alone again, even though I never was to begin with.

I wish I had a sewing room. Except not for sewing exactly- perhaps one decorated like my favorite iSpy page (the beach one) 
with playing cards and jacks and buttons and scraps of paper stapled to the wooden slats of the walls. And through the window I 
would see the beach (of course) but I wouldn't even need to look there because my eye would be always wandering around the 
walls that dripped battered brown sea. I wouldn't even sew I would just huddle there in the unending day and maybe some times I might write 
a little ditty about how the waves sounded like woman's breathing and so on. 
<br><br>
One of my most surreal memories is my mom taking me to ballet class. This was
before I could form the vision of the sidewalk/the lobby/the shape of the building we would go to. What I remember is the 
teacher telling us to gallop in a circle around the room. I was wearing pink flats with a thin ribbon bow, those shoes 
that I can recall lingering in my closet until the move, dirty and ugly and being moved from plastic bag to plastic bag 
but never taken to Goodwill. I would gingerly take them out sometimes and try them on, I found the pale oval of the top of 
my exposed foot to be so unflattering. Still, I sat in my closet and let the summer light (there was never a time of day)
filter through the blinds as I looked at them in the mirror with my dark wash skinny jeans. 
<br><br>
My mom would stay and watch us gallop and I would look at her with what I conjured as exasperation. I could not understand 
how the other girls never felt self-concious, I mean really what are we doing? I would slow my gallop and try and adjust my 
footing to look as removed as possible. And the pink leotard, the pink padded floor, wasn't it a bit much for all of us? 
This was the same time that I was going to martial arts, with dad, our thing- and I wonder if my mom wanted something like that 
with me? When she asked me (probably after the first class) if I wanted to quit I felt conflicted, I had never quit something before.
Plus, she had tried so hard to get me those pink flats. Maybe I'll take a break I said, after one class, maybe I'll come back to it.

That sounds so wonderful to spend Christmas eve with your best friend, like honestly that is a dream I am jealous, you guys will 
have some much fun - also I am excited to see the fated pants, pink pants worry me but I trust you
<br><br>
I have spent all day trying to remember the dream that I had last night, it was beautiful and vivid and I was in a version of Germany 
(which I'm now realizing has occurred in more than one of my dreams lately), I had moved into an apartment but then immediately needed 
to find one of my neighbors who had just moved out/gone missing (remember I'm aLWAYS looking for something in my dreams !!)

Hey lovely,,
<br><br>
Okay, I strongly disagree about the cheyenne/Shyanne/shianne debate. I think that Cheyenne is the worst out of the three for sure.
<br><br>
But I will admit, it does feel strange to wear pink pants in bozeman,, which just makes me want to wear them more. Especially because 
they perfectly match the new pink shoes from Mara. You'd love it.
<br><br>
I don't really know how I should handle any of this but I care about you. A lot. Insert well worded gooey stuff here. I hope you are 
doing well and that running is good and that you don't have to deal with any asshole customers.

I think that I should continue taking my meds, although as I type this I still haven't taken them the last two days. I am worried 
though, especially because I'm beginning to think I might be spinning down into the same cycle that I have been in for the last two 
years. I love change but yet still seem to cling to people and especially situations that I know.. I'm going to take my prozac this 
morning and find a psych today 
<br>[...]
<br>
I have a feeling that you are going to read this and feel some anxiety or confusion and of course I can't tell you not to feel that 
way, but I will say that I will not be behaving like old me, I am aware of the cycle and my tendencies and I think this is just me 
trying to get myself to take my fucking meds and see a therapist again. I love you

And now I have a shirt with coffee beans on it, it's large (very) and brown and tan. I also have the feeling of being physically 
drained by the last week (really 5 days but whos...) I also have a cup of coffee again, after I broke my routine the last 
few mornings and started with instant fits of anxiety and general lashing about my apartment, instead of 
my usual blend. 
<br><br>
Last night I smoked with M in a limp/stale Mannheim plaza, throwing around some theories about why everything was shit right now. 
I revealed my only secret, the fateful drive home in the snow that catalyzed my break up with Z. Telling him because it finally 
felt right but also so that I could finally say that I'd seen one of our favorite names in the game (Scotty P) scratched 
into a gas pump in middle-of-nowhere Montana. He thought that was cool. He told me that I was done-in, damaged, disregarded, 
left for dead, tied to a railroad track, by C - and that now I was attempting to do the same to him. I do agree that my quest 
to become C and throw my other (feminine?) self out to sea has to come to this logical conclusion: that C was a narcissist 
and so to truly have his life I must contract that same illness. Or perhaps contract is too passive a word. 
<br><br>
C finished their trip yesterday, posting a half-hearted thank you to all of the people they had met along the way. Now.. would 
a narcissist do that? It felt poetic to see them return home on the day that they were so prominent in my vision, 
a ghost folding around us in the dry night air. I wish her well, I wish her well. Everything feels poetic to me these days, 
which is really just another way of saying I'm losing control. I know why my grandmother 
got really into Bible study later in life- feeling around for the door handle on the dark porch, fumbling with the keys in the 
lock and thinking turn, turn just please turn.

<b>TW: bridges, boundaries and suicide</b>
<br><br>
At the risk of this entry becoming too hot for publishing (hopefully with Pearsons but I could be flexible) - I will stick to 
the concept of <b>Bridges</b>
<br><br>
Bridges signify the movement of a body from one state to another. In my Nazi culture class we discussed Leni 
Riefenstahl's use of a railway bridge to show the characters moving from the metaphorical "city" (class, society, you get it) to the 
wild and unencumbered forest, the magical other. This same professor (my favorite I've ever had) was also obsessed with this painting 
of a bridge by German Expressionist Erich Heckel (shown here): 
<center>
    <img src="3510468302_871238ca68_w.jpg" width="35%">
    <br><i>Enrich Heckel: Landschaft bei Dresden</i>(1910)
</center>
<br><br>
I wonder if Herr Dr Prof Fuller had something of a thing for bridges and this concept of boundaries/grenze throughout our lives. 
He was a perpectually sick man at least in the time I knew him, and always seemed to be teetering at the edge of the beyond. I wonder 
if he saw the bridge as more of a life or death thing than I did? Notice as well that the figure is on the bridge in Heckel's painting,
caught in perhaps intense agony (am I projecting?) between the two worlds. 
<br><br>
But I've never really been an expressionisim man myself, I much prefer the reaction - aided by my main man Brecht - of New Objectivity. 
I hate to admit that Heckel's bridge never really did much for me, other than making me wonder why he didn't make it larger? There are 
bridges that captivate me though, the suicide bridge in Portland for example: with those tacky blue signs at each end reading 
'we will help you cross this bridge'. I like to imagine the graphic designer tasked with making those signs. Which shade of cornflower
 is most likely to stop someone from catapulting themselves off? If we align left is that too burecratic? Or would people call more 
 frequently with a more friendly and poetic central alignment? It is believed that the lead singer of the Manic Street Preachers 
 commited suicide by tossing himself from a bridge after a long period of self-isolation and Alexander-Supertramp 
 style hitchhiking. Although his body was never recovered - leading to decades of speculation by his teenage, early-aughts goth fan 
 base (a bit of a D.B. Cooper situation). This all really gives a new perspective to the old 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'.
 I'd like to take this moment to share an unfinished poem that I do not believe I will finish any time soon. I justify this 
 by dating the title, for it is the sound of that day and that moment, and that is enough for me.

<br>as looking like a silverfish

<br>If I'm honest with you,
<br>this poem was supposed to be about me.

<br>But I guess I'm really up to nothing,

 The pain I feel using 'achy-brakey' unironically is actually a lyrical technique meant to conjure a similar pain in my readers, for that I apologize.

 As I sit in the cafe writing this cluster (f) two children are wandering infuriatingly close to my computer screen trying to escape 
 various real and perceived hornets. As Marie Howe says 'This is what the living do'. Max told me that I should 
 go to Alaska next year to write, that I should take writing by the balls and make it my bitch [trans, reclaimed]. 
 I agreed, then he asked 
 me what I would write about. 'I dunno' I said.

Now we reach the point where the blog must diverge: for up until this moment all of the readers were not people that I lived with. 
<br><br>
One question I have is: why I struggle to get dressed with someone watching? It's okay, you don't have to answer - I actually know already. 
<br>Getting dressed is everything. it's gender, it's confidence, it's regency era. It's the person that I am putting forth in this 
day, this moment and the intimacy of learning the process to that person , the mis-steps of where my hubris and confidence leads me 
(why would you ever think you could wear a leather vest without a shirt?). The intimacy of learning what I really think of myself, 
the person that I think that I could be- and perhaps feel I am currently inadequate for. I absolutely hate people watching me get 
dressed. 
<br><br>
Gender: And here we arrive at the main attraction. Today I walked into a dressing room and wanted to die, and who hasn't felt like that 
a fair amount of the time? I'm beginning to think that my body might be communicating to me in a sort of code, as though if I listened 
to the cadence of my body dysmorphia it might reveal itself to be stamped out SOS carried over the telegraph over and over and over. 
Yesterday I listened to this code. Took my body in my arms and said I hear what you are saying, I know that you are afraid and stressed 
and that there are things that you have not yet said. I remember when my therapist told me to try meditating, I think she was trying 
to tell me to listen closely to the code that I am sending, I just wasn't ready to hear then.

I feel a bit like I just learned how to read. In the last few hours I have been taken for a ride, held in strong cowboy arms and 
tossed into the fray of what it means to be a writer in the 2000-2015's age of the digital wild west. I'm starting to feel so close to it 
- like I am knocking at the window, have you read the TS Elliot one about the yellow fog licking the walls? (I know you have)
<br><br>
I'm not the greatest writer, or web site designer for that matter: but I'm beginning to see the seams where I may be able to hook 
a nail in (like my nipple piercing catching on a wool sweater). I'm not the greatest writer but all that I want to do is write.

of the long lowly Enumclaw streets is a poet, and not just a poet, but one with a blog, and not just 
a blog, but a blog that I recognize. And yes, you may have visited that link and realized that the only thing that happened today 
was that I discovered Blogspot. TouchÃ© - BUT I realized that I have gotten to the point in my writing development that I speak the 
language. I read a piece Tost wrote about George Oppen and while doing further research came upon this:

Nevermind what any of that means, the point is that I know those guys! I'm not the greatest writer, but I do love to write. NOW I feel 
often that I must pull myself away from writing, that I feel so compelled to send this indigestible nothing-no substance strings of 
thought into your computer that I cannot and do not wish to do anything else. And perhaps someone else with something real and important 
to say started there too?

Where I'm from:
<br><br>
There's a band called Enumclaw now, which was actually formed in Tacoma. A few years ago someone told me about them and I hate to say that 
I didn't really give a shit and thought they were just another Modest Mouse wannabe, which I have since walked back. I realized earlier 
this week that Enumclaw was playing at the capital hill block party along with Cannons and my shining star: the GECS - this really piqued 
my interest and I visited their apple music page.. 
<br><br>
I'm considering writing a review for their new album when it comes out so I won't say much here but suffice to say, seeing 'Fruit Flies'
by Enumclaw appear on my phone scatters me in a way I have never felt. It's like opening up your school 
district website to connect to the wifi but suddenly it's not your school district anymore it's an indie rock band and you're crying. 
<br><br>
There's a few core themes to Enumclaw that I've always wanted to write about: one was the logging roads. I'd stand after school in the 
gravel parking lot and chat shit with the country kids next to their trucks as they idled them in no hurry to leave. They would say 
there was a party at mile marker 16 and I would imagine them driving there late at night, driving drunk and high and never getting lost 
on those old dark roads. I imagined that they would walk into the brush and build their fire as big as a funeral pyre and 
be with each other in that drunken homoerotic haze. I loved the country kids, and they loved me back. But they never invited me to their 
parties at mile marker 16, I think they knew that I couldn't let myself be taken by the drugs and the cold mountain pines the way that 
they could. 
<br><br>
I lost my virginity on a logging road. As constructed as the concept of virginity is, it is what I named this event at the time, so 
I will honor that. My boyfriend and I drove up into the hills and stopped at a pull-out outside of Mud Mountain Dam. I was sober 
and beautiful and had horrible sex in the back of a souped-up subaru with stickers on the windows. The pull-outs outside of Mud 
Mountain were notorious for this, you'd drive up and see other cars parked loosly on gravel, as we all spread out over the maze of roads 
and found our quite places in the moonlight. The logging roads represented the ultimate freedom, many of them forgotten and left to 
be reclaimed by the weeds and bushes that slowly closed in around them. 
<br><br>
One of my other boyfriends had a brother who died up on these logging roads. Not far from where I had stopped with J four years before. 
They found the car abandoned at the pull-out the next morning, but the brother and his girlfriend had vanished. The town searched 
for their bodies for a week before they were found caught up in the branches of the White river. It was announced that they had both drowned, had 
apparently gone swimming in early February, or, the town hypothesized: were caught in a flash flood. 
<br><br>
I wonder if the band Enumclaw knows about the logging roads there, if they ever drove up at night and stopped at a pull-out to shoot the 
shit and do what kids do. The surrounding areas don't have roads like this, you can't just keep driving into the wild until you are 
completely alone, with no neighbors and no towns - Enumclaw is the last stop before the foothills become impenetrable woods, all the 
way to Mt Rainier. Occasionally hikers or wandering residents would get lost in these woods. There was a man who had walked away 
from his nursing home and was rumored to have been seen out on the logging roads. He was never found, but a few months after he went missing 
I was running up in the hills and heard a whistle calling out over a large fen. There were no trails on the other side of the meadow, just 
the swamp and pines that I could barely see lining the opposite side. The whistle came long and loud, repeating for a few minutes and then stopped, 
and I did not hear it again. 
<br><br>
As we moved through the town this was the constant, pressing feeling- that Enumclaw was bounded by ghosts, and I think even outsiders 
can hear that in the name. There's something not quite right about it, a sound that you are not supposed to make. I'm becoming more 
aware of the presence of place in my life and in others, and I hold the name Enumclaw like a secret gem. I've started saying it like 
a spell.

<br>
<br>
Last night I queued up 'Lauren' by Men I Trust completely on instinct and a Gemini-Scorpio (wow. talk about problems.) immidiately 
woke up and said : oh my god 
<br><br>
I met K for coffee on the pretext that his girlfriend would also be joining us. the assignment? talk shop (poly)
<br>the important part was that I listened to Men I Trust while waiting for him at the coffee shop - that and he said one thing 
I've been thinking about this morning : 
<br><br>Me: <i>Are you worried about your relationship being hierarchical? Think about vetos, like hypothetically of course - 
    your partner could make you stop seeing someone if they didn't like them - and then suddenly you have to break up with 
someone you love, but only because of someone else. I think that's quite painful. </i>
<br><br>
K (aries): <i>We aren't too worried about that - since we both view falling in love as an active thing - falling in love is 
    making decisions and moving in a direction, wouldn't it take time to fall in love like that? 
</i>
<br><br>
Is love an active thing? I'm sure it is for some people - those that have a very finite sense of love, 
that perhaps understand what they mean when they say it - oh god for me though, the thought of an active love, a decisive love? The 
possibility of stamping it out and walking away like nothing ever happened? The only other aries in my sphere right now thinks like 
this too, 'he wanted something different from me, so I just stopped talking to him, I knew it wasn't a good path for me' 
<br><br>
Much has been said (and written) about love, probably everything that there is to say. Still - I often find that I feel a sinking 
anxiety with love that only dissipates when I spend time on this circular track, the love-slurry that never seems to become 
clearer but does, somehow, start to make me feel better after a while:  
<br><br>
Gemini-Scorpio: <i>I love Men I Trust, is this Lauren?</i>
<br><br>
Me: <i>Yes</i>
<br><br>
Gemini-Scorpio: <i>My girlfriend loves this song. We should definitely date.</i>
<br><br>
Me: <i>Yes</i>
<br><br>
Is this a defining feature of polyamory? Obviously not since there's such stoic logisticians in our ranks - so perhaps 
it's tied to my obsession with community? I apologize that I haven't made any effort to define love, or the pain I feel, or 
what I'm trying to find here, I'd direct your attention to this anecdote of the time someone caught me after the mosh at 
Together Pangea and said 'I'm sorry but I think I fell in love with your spunk' 
<br><br>
Now that, THAT is what love means to me. When I said 'I love you' to Max for the first time it was at my parents house. All of 
my friends from high school had come to dinner and of course, we'd had a wonderful time. After everyone left, or perhaps the next 
day, I felt sure that it was the moment to say it. This story is sweet but it's overly-simplified - because 
of course I loved Max the moment that we started chatting shit at the party when we met. It only took months for me to feel that 
I had successfully followed the societal code: don't say love too fast, people don't like to hear 'I love you' too fast - 
It's strange though because we don't have this code for our friends, or even strangers - somehow the farther you are from someone 
the easier it is to say 'I love you'. I understand this on some level, but it also feels a bit constructed to me- a bit puritanical if you will. 
When I say 'I love you' I'm really just saying I will miss you, and I miss almost everyone. And maybe that is really the issue at hand here.

Heidegger.  
<br><br>
I think that I might be low on iron, as I haven't been taking my iron pills while I've been here and have felt extremely 
low energy during the day the last few weeks. I have so much to do: a report on Bertolt Brecht, a few assignments I've 
been putting off from creative writing, perpetual programming to show my advisor that I'm still devoted to 
urban mammal research. Heidegger would call 
all of these problems the small b of being, not the larger overall conversation of Being (sein vs Sein). I know this because 
instead of starting on any of these endeavors, I watched a 45 minute lecture on Heidegger this afternoon. Which incidentally, is 
the exact decision that Heidegger proposes is the key to self ascension/life/whatever. I know that my true Being is concerned with this blog, 
and with carefully selecting the decisions/ROADS DIVERGING in my life that are most Me. I know that left to my own devices 
I would be spending the evening writing out a surrealist sketch I thought up on my run last night (think John Malkovitch 
meets my bad poetry) and oh yeah, also writing a blog post responding to Martin Heidegger- but instead I seem to feel guilty 
about these decisions (Guilt being: 'the uncomfortable certainty that we are not what we could have been.', thank you Martin) - 
<br><br>
I feel guilty because I know that I can not just Be a philosopher. I cannot just Be a writer. I simply don't have enough to say, 
and people don't need to listen. When I met C I realized that HERE, in THEM, I had come upon someone who could just 
become a philosopher, could just move through the world and think and write 
and be themselves. Q recently told me she was proud of me for meeting so many people and living so fluidly, I 
said, I just want to be like C, I'm copying them, I stole them, I'm doing what they do. Applying this to Heidegger: if my true call to 
Being is this, writing, pondering myself and the state of it All, moving to the philosophical capital of the world (Melbourne, Australia),
and living like a rich, white 6'8'' philosophy student- it's really just a bit self flaggelating isnt it? My qualm with Heidegger's 
focus on individual ascension is the problem of the collective - which I'm sure an entire movement has already said but seeing as I've 
never taken philosophy I'm coining it now - Heidegger seems to misunderstand that while he is a bright shining individual in his own 
mind, he is really an ant in the scheme of human development. As was the problem with C, and perhaps all narcissists- that while it 
may feel incredibly rewarding for them to be reading, processing, saying all the time: they fail to recognize that the collective 
has built the pedestal for them. I cannot be a philosopher because I need to get back to work, there's something more here that I can 
add to benefit ACTUAL ants, and not the even less important lives of C and long-dead German thinkers. The pursuit of individual ascension
is like learning how to juggle. A few very strange people might find it fun at parties while the rest of us wish we could turn back to 
our conversations and stop watching the years of strenuous practice forced out in meaningless and fleeting seconds.  
<br><br>
A Return to Nihilism: 
<br>
Speaking of meaningless and fleeting- So why care about actual ants then? It's all about the collective baby! Call me a biologist but, our purpose is to fulfill our biological 
role as humans on the landscape- a more complex asking now that our role has become reckoning with our own very-human eros. Am I saying that 
Heidegger would have been better off sitting in an empty room refreshing Ecosia than wasting valuable resources with all of his inks and 
papers? No, I'm saying that it's extremely Nazi of him to fail to understand that the people, small b beings, plants, and ants around him 
were facillitating his every thought. Of course, we can't all be bug scientists- and that's exactly what I'm saying. 
What I am Actually, Really, Truly saying is that I need to stop writing this and run a few datasets through the R script before my meeting this evening, 
and Heidegger should be thanking me.

My conciousness/being/thoughts are being pulled across the expanse and out of my hands - winds lifting up and taking 
many kites sailing in different directions. I can't seem to catch any of them, and while I enjoy watching them sail down the hillside, 
(name that tune) I feel a pitching fear that they are out alone, perhaps not to come back for .. the afternoon at least.
<br><br>
I'm not bad though, far from it, in actuality I feel so narcissitically beautiful that I could jump out of my skin, that my skin 
and myself and my perceptions of how <i>they</i> are seeing me are a thinning veil, that I have at once become so unabashed that I no longer 
know or recognize myself. Who am I when I am confident? Am I someone who texts D - the wandering figment that I swore off only 
a few long scrolls below? Becoming aware that he had entered my inner realm (the continent of europe) was a curse of course, <b>forcing
</b>(you wouldn't understand) me to listen to the song that I assigned to my memory of him back when he stopped 'knocking on my door' 
freshman year. 
<br><br>
<i>When you decided to knock on my door / did you remember what happened before?</i>
<br><i>Did you agree we should let it be? / and did you agree...it's a must</i>
<br><br>
<i>Let's call the whole thing off / We just have had enough of us</i>
<br><i>Let's call the whole thing off / We just have had enough of us </i>
<br><br>
Thanks for that, Peter Bjorn and John, you swedish fucks. This song always makes me feel better about D - counterintuive: since it 
is obviously (to me at least) about staying instead of going. Notoriously, NOT what D chose to do, when he set extremely clear and 
coherent boundaries for himself and chose to walk away from a relationship he knew would be difficult and painful for both of us- how 
truly gracious. 
<br><br>
What does it mean that this ghost is travelling with his sweet european dad about 5 hours south of me? It should mean little seeing as he 
stepped into the same hottub as me only a few months before, to my great distress but .. survivable. The question is - will god bring us 
together in a fitful Melbourne-colored dream, or will we be normal, have no contact (because why would we?) and return to Portland on 
our respective, uneventful flights to continue our normal fucking lives. The distress comes from the inevitability of the latter, 
that even were we to meet - it would be impossible that anything could happen but a light hello and one of us running full speed into the 
opposite direction. The song comforts me because there is a decision being made, one that I continue to think that I am making 'day in ..
day out' but three+ years later it remains a mental contract null and void by the time it's ever challenged. 
<br><br>
I won't reach out to him, I don't care about him, we're calling the whole thing off. 
<br><br>
And YET - my gut reaction is the opposite, even my interpretation of the song remains one of hopeless infatuation, insead of any real unbreakable resolve. 
How can my emotions remain so outside of my control? How can I be so different from myself 3 years ago, yet feel these same currents? 
And Another Thing! Jealousy runs rampant - jealousy that he could possibily be having a better time, seeing better places, 
and altogether ENTERING these cities that <b>I have laid claim </b> (in the self-centeredness and incoherancy only available to an American studying 
abroad) <b>to</b>. 
<br><br>
Well, at least I'll always have C to distract me from my pining with..a vegemite sandwich. How is loving always felt most in the act of 
losing? (add citation) - actually I would argue- in finding, only ever the most unsatisfying scraps.

How do I come back to center? I feel horribly unfocused and distracted, as though I'm constantly bored and overwhelmed at the same time. 
I keep ignoring things that I must do, or should do, in favor of what? I lost the point of what we were all reaching for, and now I just keep 
drinking coffee. I fear that I was one flip phone purchase away from this fate but now, instead, have reached

Yesterday, in session (poetry)- T reminded us that we can always look for inspiration in our old scrawlings and in working with the exercises 
we share in group once and then retire to our notebooks. I like T because her notebook looks very much like mine, it's indecipherable 
letters conceal that she is actually one of the finest writers this side of the Mississippi - 
<br><br>
In taking her advice to heart I was going to share the poem I started gingerly in group yesterday but in flipping through I 
discovered something else that seemed more 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHN7QoFU130" target="_self" style="text-decoration:none; color: rgb(124, 124, 255);">Deadlines (Thoughtful)</a>: 
<br><br>
<i> I've followed you into the endless night, you are forever leaning on the chapped steps, fondly we circle each other, 
    nights like these never happen, only coming in memory and daydream.
    <br><br>
    look into the burning color of the streetlamp above us, feel my hand where there is no hesitation, I see you're moving without 
    thinking, let the light of the city swallow us in this night.
    <br><br>
    morning will never come here, only in the ache and love of the light above us, listen to it buzz, you can't hear me
    over the waking of the bugs in the foaming air, you can't walk, can't turn your head to me, you're locked in this crumbling 
    stone, left perfect on the street side, painted in reflected colors, you are the sound, you are the holy vision. 
</i>
<br><br>
Wow. Okay. I find this work interesting (look I'm teaching you how to make the sausages!) because I have this scene in my head that I can't be rid of: the steps, the street, the night, the street light, I wrote basically the same moment in my last transmission- 
not realizing that I'd already thought of it an unknown amount of days before..I'm stuck in this vision, like many others, 
that are at once fantasy and memory. The vision of the street lamp is very eternal to me, I often think that if I was a painter I would 
paint many empty landscapes with streetlights hazing off into <i>the lip of oblivion</i>, they are the most captivating figment to me, 
a childish wonder in the vein of 'where DOES the sidewalk end?' and staying with me in the questions of cultivated emotions in the grand 
 scheme (game) of human society, 
 <h1 style="color:darkcyan; font-size:100%; font-weight: 60; ">
It starts simply:
<br><br>
The streetlight was placed near the road to light it for cars, and for passers-by. Many years ago the city planners took inspiration 
from other city planners and said, we will add streetlights!
<br><br>
Now the streetlight is a character, for me, as I was formed by the carefully planned (or perhaps not so, if you've ever been there) 
city of Auburn, Washington. I noticed that the streetlight also concealed, lighting only the small circle of sidewalk outside my house, and the rest?
not the perview of those planners all those years ago, the desert if you will.
<br><br>
When I use the streetlight as a symbol to myself of mystery, love, desire, pain, everything overarching in my life and the question 
I'm always falling back on of- why I feel so drawn to it? the urge to write that is, 
<br><br>
I wonder, was that also the designed function of the streetlight? to draw me (and the bugs) from my house to sit and stare from my steps - 
is the utilitarian act of the streetlight why this dichotomy draws me so? or is there mutual understanding between us all, that the streetlight always carries 
the precarious youth of the night with it too? 
</h1>
<br>
As I was writing this entry I took a large glug of the coffee I had left on my desk from yesterday afternoon and as the 
BOLUS of coffee entered my mouth I saw the still squirming body of a fruit fly be flushed with the liquid to become stuck to the inner side of the 
cup, a few centimeters below my lip. Perhaps that is my sign I should get back to things? Or at least make new coffee.

I've lost the thread! but here's this you little hungry (non rap) scallions :
<br><br>
SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO WRITE:
<br><br>
We leave the bar in a hurry, she's stomping into the street and kicking the trash cans as she goes. the streetlights burn red this time of night, 
and I stop listening to her footsteps to focus on the drone of the flies around the lamps. she never looks back as I waver, and when I turn back towards the 
hollow buildings she has gone. the trash smells like rotting meat, a burning smell. above me, the moths and gnats fly in thin ribbons, feeding from the 
dumpsters.
<br>
--------
<br>
I have a horrible habit of rereading my own writing in a horrendous self-soothing fugue state in which I get absolutely nothing new accomplished and simply 
relay my own words back into my head as if I don't get <b>ENOUGH</b> of that living in my own brain day in/day out. Even this sentence I've probably reread several 
times and will continue to reread - (note to future huntr, stop getting meta, it's bad for you) - 
<br><br>
But since we're having fun today and I'm procrastining writing an 'actual piece of worthwhile expression' (titled 'me being horny in class' or 'Joseph von Eichendorff 
der Gefangene, 1826') I wanted to reread (skim, it's 77 pages) the story that I wrote in 10th grade english for 30 points of extra credit that I definitely did not 
need. The story terrifies me not the least because it's the cringiest thing I've ever read, but also because it acts as too-expansive porthole into both a forgotten and formative time in my life. Rereading it is like skimming over a minefield hoping that I don't uncover anything too hot for therapy. It's too much information. plain 
and simple. I had forgotten how closely I collaborated with current little scallion, E, on this undertaking back in 10th grade. We have several emails together 
from various phases of the writing process (me coming home from school and writing furiousy for several hours during the month of November (I forgot to say 
nanowrimo but hopefully that clears something up for you))- I eventually completely incorperated E as two supporting characters utilizing both her first and last name 
respectively, gave her a love interest (that I know nothing about because I was too embarrassed to reread those parts), and just generally wrote a 77 page fan fiction-
so what? 
<br><br>
The story ends in a <b>TWIST</b>  <h1 style="font-size:100%; font-weight: 60;">why did we have to read so many fucking YA novels with twists? just give the kids Great Expections for the love of.. </h1> 
<br>
At the end you realize that the main protagoist was actually not experiencing any of the 76 pages 
of gritty teen adventure that came before. Instead, they were writing fan fiction in their room, romantizing the mundane events of their life and finding themselves 
unable to actually leave the house: unable to enter the reality beyond the door. I will include the final paragraph here in it's entirety, I suggest one particular little scallion 
be sitting down when they read this for reasons that will become obvious in a moment: 
<br><br>
<a href="findinglife.html" target="_self"> <i>finding life: the final page</i> </a>
<br><br>
Damn, pretty crazy huh? Now that I believe in God a lot has started to make more and less sense to me, namely how I got away with not believing in god/signs/signals 
sooner? To be clear, although I used painfully relevant names, places and events for almost everything in the story- this final name was disconnected from me. I think 
I chose it because it belonged to the girl I never stood up for in middle school when she got laughed at for sticking her finger in an electrical socket and shocking 
herself during 6th grade history. A story I feel bad for loving so deeply that I continued telling it ... up to right now. 
<br><br>
Well, sadly I don't think I'll be including any more excerpts from <i>finding life</i>, unless it becomes highly requested- those who wish to read more can check out 
Wattpad and find much the same writing style and content (with better sex) featured there.

Wait! I just remembered I didn't see my mom come home last night. Where was she this morning? Looking into the teal green of the next door stairwell I think about the 
beginning of the end, how she decended after the pregnancy, what had happened anyway? Where has she been for the last few years? The years she was in and out of 
treatment- and now she's gone forever? or just missing again? The question is why dad never told me, why didn't he say something when she was obviously missing 
at dinner? I can't ask him right now, I have to go to get my hair cut- I just called, 'do you have any appointments today?', 'does 10 pm work for you?'
'yes.' - I picked her up, meeting at the place where the red dirt slopes down the embankment in down-right dunes, a red desert at the side of the freeway. 
Why did I wear my broken boots? I need to run, we'll never make it by 10, and my boots are tied together in ribbon. I'm pulling her down the red sand, she's keeping 
up effortlessly until I get distracted, crossing the freeways back and forth to the bottom and the train station appears, I pull her in- I'm sure I see them, C, 
wearing my clothes- lingering at the edge of the platform. They notice me, and so does their partner standing between us, they are both morphing into people and people,
their faces are fluid, what did they look like again? C smirks at me, I try and climb the red sand to offer a goodbye, the standard european hug offered out of necessity, 
not want, but the sand is suddenly too thick and I am sliding down, my muscles hard and slow, I'm crawling. 
<br><br>
I don't have time, it's 10:01. We are at the destination. we're ordering pizza. 'wait, what if I want a haircut?' the waiter: 'that closed already' 
<br><br>
'but I have an appointment'
<br><br>
'why would you have an appointment at 10 pm?'
<br><br>
She's ordering, I'm paying- the cashier (italian): 'that's 90 euros', I walk back to her, 'can we get it without the dessert?' She laughs, we'll split it. 
Maybe she looks like Lina? she's pulled me to the floor, 'I love being with someone who doesn't care about the rules' she tells me as I worry about the 
managements' views on PDA on their carpet. I'm remembering the times we've come here before, she's changed since then, gotten more carefree. 
But do I even like her? Back into the nighttime 
and we're at the walls, thick cement carved in thousands of pictographs. She looks up and smiles because there are thousands of honey bees carved in the ceiling.
I really need to ask my dad about mom. Now I'm certain she isn't coming home. The pictographs begin to make sense to me, I can read them all clearly- 
every word in every language. If only I could remember what they said.

<b><i> Berghain </i></b>
<br><br>
Berghain is an imposing 5-story industrial building that looks a bit like what a city hall in hell would look like. Okay I'm embellishing, the outside is a grey-beige and has 
a collection of stickers and tags decorating the wire fences, the entrance is in back so you have to wander around the large complex looking embarrassed as men in giant 
boots snicker at you and walk confidently to the corral. When we got in line two short men in t-shirts sitting 
on a concrete stoop asked us if we knew where Berghain was, a joke as old as time. I will say I didn't start to feel the power of the building until we got closer, the line was 
underwhelmingly short, only 50 or so people, when I had been primed for hundreds, thousands. It's the greatest club in the world after all- we'll get there. 
<br><br>
I had no reference for Berghain before coming to Germany, but the name did give me a feeling of intrigue, a light 'maybe I have heard that somewhere before'? C was the first person I 
remember saying Berghain to me, although I don't think I even heard what they said at the time, 'Berghain' simply fell into my conciousness 
through osmosis. Shortly thereafter the club got talked up by somehow everyone that I met. Yet,
other than C, nobody had actually seen inside. I did some indepedent research, found the tourist guides about tips for getting in, the articles about the 'hardest door in the 
world', and I was absolutely hooked on it. I knew I'd get in, it was just a matter of how many times I'd have to try. Once I saw the rest of the line I was even more sure, 
the themes were queer, fetish and black lace- and I was wearing the lace corset I bought on Division with my ex girlfriend, slam dunk. 
<br><br>
Once we were 3 people from the door I was able to read the paper taped above one of the three, large ALL BALD bouncers. It was 22 euros to enter and cash only. 
I had 10 euros in my pocket and whispered to F that we should just get cash and come back, I figured getting to the front and asking them if they had a card reader was 
not part of the Ten Tourtist Tricks, but F said lets just see if they let us in first. I think she wanted a bit more of a demonstration than I did, confidently striding 
out to tell her grandkids 'I got into Berghain but decided not to pay the cover'. But at this point the three people in front of us had already been turned away- the 
woman saying 'why?' and the bouncer saying 'because you asked'- and we were being sized up. I chose to look at the bouncer in front of the door only, keeping my eyes on 
his and letting C's greatest teaching run through my mind, 'if you want to be someone who fucks, you just have to pretend you are'. The bouncer nodded and motioned for us to go in. 
We were sheparded by more bald bouncers into a bright green room with boxes overflowing with confiscated bottles of every color of liquid. A friendly man (not bald) put a bright orange 
sticker over the cameras on my phone and explained the rules I'd already studied on clubguideberlin.de, we then stood completely silently at the counter until F resignedly explained 
that we actually had no cash and would have to return, they understood - once you're in Berghain, you're family - and we scampered back in with cash a half hour later. 
<br><br>
The 'lobby' of Berghain is a cavernous room painted a hideous (my favorite) puke green, with people in various stages of undress/nakedness waiting at the GARDEROBE counter. 
One of many low couches sits to one corner with queers lounging delicately like a renaissance painting. These couches would become a theme of Berghain for me, every floor, 
bar, room, hallway, balcony, dungeon, bathroom, was adorned with a low couch seating absolutely effortless human connection. People lolled, or pulsed, depending on where you 
looked in the mass. You ascend from the decently-lit lobby on a black metal staircase to enter what has the feeling of an industrial warehouse. But you aren't actually sure what you're seeing because you can't understand the scale of the 
ceilings and the dimensions of the crowd - suddenly everything has become endless black fog, with only colored lazers - thick shapes like a Kandinsky painting - cutting across 
your vision in huge vertical spotlights. It was like finding yourself in the middle of a thunderstorm. 
<br><br>
I knew I had to see every inch of Berghain before I could fully enjoy what was obviously the main attraction, so I began scouting the surrounding bar areas and upper floors. 
Moving around in Berghain involves slithering around on cast iron bridges and stairwells, as though you are always on a fire escape. People 
are everywhere, sitting in the walls, in the nooks, in the rafters. I found several bars quickly, including an upper section with ice cream (the fat fetish community 
salutes you Berghain). One of the bars was made of glass counters holding what appeared to be amber resin sculptures of mummified women. They lay flat under the drinks 
and clutched their hands together dreamily. The bar where I ordered my gin & tonic was manned by an excited bartender who forgot to give F her coke and left when I was about 
to pay. She jumped completely into the arms of what I assumed was her coworker but may have just been someone ordering a drink, hugging them tightly with both her arms and legs. community. 
<br><br>
I know I use the word Labrynth liberally on this blog but I must emphasize the sprawling maze of foggy hallways that make up Berghain. The way that new rooms materialize,
and change meaning once you enter them. It's a bathroom! you think, then turn the corner and are walking along a wall of human sized compartments, a woman is lunging out 
at you and ricocheting back to her partner. You enter a room with a balcony over the grand floor, everything is hazed in blue and suddenly you see that the room is 
only low couches and one long bed facing the dancefloor. Someone is sleeping on it peacefully. We were greeted by a Berghain regular at one point, a touching little 
moth who flitted to us to ask if we had been made uncomfortable at any time during the night. We smiled and said we had been having a lovely time, to which this transpired: 
<br><br><i>
Regular: that's wonderful, it's been a great night for me too - I accidently did Ketamine instead of Methadone earlier - but I just sat with the bouncers and they kept an 
eye on me until I felt better
<br><br>
Me: you can do that? 
<br><br>
Regular: yes! It's even written on your bracelet 'if you need support, please contact any member of our team' - sometimes they change it though, it used to say 
'don't forget to leave'
<br><br>
Me: It's so nice that they would be understanding and kind about drugs 
<br><br>
Regular: yes, lets hope there's nothing spiked floating around tonight- if you're ever holding a drink and looking away from it remember to cover it with your hand like this, 
and watch out for each other. But let's not talk about it anymore, I don't want to bring any more bad energy in here tonight- 
<br><br>
END SCENE: Regular returns to the K-hole 
<br><br></i>
I won't bore you with any further details of my personal imprint on Berghain (what I added to the global conversation) - what I will say is what Berghain whispered to me, 
that not anyone can cook, but a good cook can come from anywhere. I had wanted to talk about the intersection of exclusivity, "chosenness", beauty and confidence- but 
I'll save that for when I feel like shit again. Peace Love and Unity.

<b>TW: ED</b>
<br><br>
<b>Ghost in (my) shell-</b> I watched another Herbs & Alters video this morning and per usual it got my little brain working. Dorian was talking about 
the isolation of ED's and just like very broad strokes what happens to your body during periods where you're restricting. It was actually 
very validating because I often forget that I did in fact follow all of the signs/stages/acheivement badges of an ED. I think we all tend 
to downplay our traumatic experiences but the truth was that I was extremely isolated during that period of my life. To the point that 
I don't remember any of the small moments from that summer. I remember going to the red woods because that was when I entered marble-world, 
and I remember going to summer camp with L because I had to decide how much of an ED I wanted to present to the 
extremely impressional children around me. I felt guilty that I wasn't eating as much as them, because I knew that I should be their healthy, 
stable role model. I remember there was a presentation mid-week about the female athlete triad, the relationship between losing your period, 
losing bone density, and losing energy. The presentation was in a scared-straight style, telling the kids that if they lost their period for 
a month they would immidiately begin losing bone density and likely get a stress fracture. If they somehow lost their period for 3 consecutive months 
they would be medically diagnosed with amenorrhea and most definitely get a stress fracture and have low bone density for the rest of their little lives. 
I remember looking around the room of hundreds of kids sitting on the floor and just feeling this sinking shame, I hadn't had my period for almost a year 
at this point. I left the presentation and told L that the presentation was a bit much, I don't remember how she responded. 
<br><br>
The other moments from that summer are completely lost to me, I think that I was spending a lot of time at home, but I have no memory of what I was 
doing. I think that I would visit M sometimes, since he was living 45 minutes away with his parents most of the summer, but I often had a breakdown 
before getting in the car to drive there, and wouldn't go. I was in deep shit, I have a few videos saved on my phone from that time and I don't think 
I knew who I was in any way, or how to speak, think, exist. Dorian spoke about the connection between ED and age-regression, which I think is a fascinating 
concept. They said that in their experience, periods of restriction often made them feel drawn to childrens activitys/toys- perhaps due to the hormonal 
supression of losing your period, or perhaps due to our societal understanding of thinness being tied to childhood/youth. I wonder if that contributed to 
my sudden decision to work as a camp counselor (a path I cannot imagine taking before or since), and further- if I was feeling afraid of growing up in 
some way? I think we all are afraid of ageing, but I also have moments of euphoria for being an adult, L and I drove to get coffee one morning before 
the kids woke up and the power of that- I had short hair and cool earrings and I felt like one of the older girls with piercings that would go to my 
dojo all those years ago. Still, I can have grace (thank you therapy) for the fear that I was feeling towards my own development 
at this time. I was on the cusp of completely re-understanding myself as NB/male and that was about to put a lot of things into a new perspective. I was 
feeling frustrated with sex at this time, and I kept telling M that I thought I was a lesbian. In retrospect, I've learned that having an ED just represses 
your desire for sex and really any feeling at all, so my confusion might have been less gender-caused and more just the bodily/chemical reality. Still, 
I can recognize that I was standing blindfolded at the edge of a very anxious-femme cliff, about to dive into a beautiful new conception of myself but 
only feeling the rock crumbling at the edge below my feet.

        I can finally look back on the events of the last weekend now that we were all let down by the Strokes (I kid) and can move along 
with our lives. This was my first festival and I think I get it. It is (as every fucking person says) like a beautiful little bubble of solidarity, 
especially since I loved so many of the bands. I felt incredibly at peace, which incidentally is what my tarot cards 
predicted when I read last week (adding THAT to my confirmation bias). The come down is still a bit hard though, like how I never 
remember that alcohol has a come down as well.. I also missed M (is this his 
first mention in these transmissions?) since so many of the bands were ones that we listen to together. There was something absolutely 
girl-boss-exquisite about going with Q though, just the pure, raw love of friendship and listening to beautiful music together. I got 
to show her alt-J and she showed me Wolf Alice, and we both cried during Big Thief and my lord and savior Florence & the Machine. 
<br><br>
At one 
point (before the entry of the mouth harp to the stage) Big Thief was singing about her mother, and that started hitting quite intensely. 
I wonder if when (when I don't) publish these fumbled pages into my manifesto I'll look back and realize it was all just me writing to my 
mother, finally filling our journal covered in dust in her bedside drawer. I started to cry because I realized that my mother didn't 
even know that I loved alt-J, that she didn't even know where I was right then, that if she saw me here she wouldn't even recognize me. Maybe 
that means I need to let her more into my life, she did reach out after my last instagram post- asking me to please tell her what the creature 
was featured there (a hedgehog mom?) and I haven't responded, so I suppose I'm the distant one in all of this. I think I feel a bit hurt though,
since there are things that I try and tell her, and I always feel like she isn't listening. When I told her that I was going to Germany I 
explained that I was going for a semester, studying, all of it- and the week before I left she asked me who my host family was, 
and 'you're staying a few weeks? visiting Nadine?'. I know she's self-admittedly senile but it stung. I know this is a universal 
experience, that your parents never quite listen or know you, but I feel like mine might be particularly distant. It always feels a bit 
Dickens going home to the big farm house and us all sitting at the too-big kitchen table, saying nothing but keeping a traditional and 
severe reverence for each other (how warm indeed).

And here we are, arriving and leaving - on the train again. And where are we going? Q and I are an hour outside of Berlin, 
about to enter the ascension point, I slept for an hour last night and since then I've been pitter pattering about street trees,
having a lovely time with Q, thoroughly appreciating the view as our train coasts into the daylight- 
<br><br>
I knew that I was going to like Berlin, and so maybe that's part of the reason I do like it, so much. I don't remember if I felt this 
way about Portland too, that it was a dream- then became the only place that I could imagine myself being, then of course- after a few 
months reality began to set in. There are concrete things that I like here though, things I can pinpoint beyond just a carefully-curated 
global aesthetic that Berlin has managed to seed in my heart since I started German classes at 15. I like the wide streets, it makes 
moving through the city feel so peaceful, nobody is in your way or angry with you. On my run yesterday I felt that I could run comfortably 
anywhere in the city, and what a beautiful prospect for me. Berlin streets are quiet and lead into beautiful 
gardens and large swaths of undeveloped land, sections of forested swamps and fields right in the center of the city. It feels so balanced,
the line between STREET and TREES (!) - I also like the people here, so far the festival goers and the shop keepers have all been lovely, 
someone rode by on their bike yesterday and told me I was doing great on my run, it's the little things. 
<br><br>
I suppose I have conflicting 
feelings about this love I feel for Berlin. I'm weary of it, like all love, because there is always the possibility that it won't last. 
I'm not sure how I first felt drawn to Portland, likely it was catalyzed by Portlandia as sad as that is to admit (although I do love that 
show still), I think Portland represented a freedom for me that Seattle didn't. Seattle was a known quantity, my parents both understood 
and knew their way around there, we'd spent days there together, that was their city. But Portland could be mine, and it was marketed as 
open, queer, weird, etc. Was it everything that I expected? I suppose, but I realized that Portland has a slimy coating to it- an incredible 
and palpitable hypocrisy that is at once acknoledged in most circles (the ever present antifa mantra 'we hate Portland'), and simultaniously
has only gotten more severe in the time I've lived there. I know I'm not the first to say this but the claim that Portland is a woke 
city while thousands of people are sleeping on the streets and in their cars -- it's unforgivable. Portland is a sham, it's people who are 
constantly presenting themselves as better/different/poor/cool while inside they don't even understand why they are doing any of it. Maybe 
that's just college, and of course I am no exception- I'm constantly presenting, seeing what works, adjusting, trying to put forth 
something at once grudge and at the other- professional. It's a ridiculous dance - but I haven't noticed it present here. It doesn't feel 
like we are clawing at each other, perhaps communal (!!) is more what I'm trying to say. 
<br><br>
Anyway, I thought I should tell you all that I literally communicated with alt-J yesterday. We made a few friends at the show before and 
I was absolutely unhinged talking about how excited I was for alt-J. It paid off (like always) because this very tall fellow offered to 
lift me up on his shoulders for a song since he could tell that I was absolutely rabid. He said to just tap him when I was ready which 
presented an incredible decision to me of what blessed/perfect song I should choose to ascend to (having a vague knowledge of the 
set list from their Seattle show but of course unsure if their festival show might be different). I tried to go deep inside and know that 
I would feel when the time was right, and of course, as alt-J always does, I felt the moment perfectly. Of course, I should ascend to 
Chicago <br><br>
<i> an apparition lifts me up / from its shoulders I sit and see your face above the tree-line </i> <br>
<i> your reassurances subtited in American English / I am calm as we sail down the hillside </i>
<br><br>
It was beautiful, I was seen and loved and cherished by my favorite band for one little moment. Maybe sometimes, dreams do come true. 
Enough of this, I'll catch you guys later.

Oh God, I really should be getting started on my long run- or the coding I need to work on for D (not that one)- but I really want 
to write about something- or maybe just prolong the time until I need to move my body through space for 1.75 hours. I was speaking with 
a friend about this earlier this week, I think I may have come off fake deep and overly 'psychology major', but she was studying 
sociology so I'm not sure if she cared. But what I was trying to convey was the interesting nature of sport and exercise in the grand 
scheme of one's day, that we as humans have an innate need to move through space, in the same category as eating/drinking/sleeping. And
you're probably thinking, okay you ableist cunt (reclaimed)- that must be so great for you but people can live really fulfilling lives 
without incessant movement, and I'm sure that's true - I'm speaking from within the confines of my own body, one that both liberates 
and holds me hostage, and saying that my body's need to fling itself through space is something that I find so primal. M responded to this 
saying, yes, it's about getting out of your head. And she's right, but also wrong. During the worst periods of my ED I could not run, 
but it wasn't physical, it was because I would stop at the edge of the track and cry, completely unable to control (IN THE MOST 
FUCKED SENSE OF THE WORD) my body, feeling 
only an overwhelming hatred, that I wanted to grasp myself in iron hands and shape myself into someone else. I couldn't move because 
moving was an invitation to be so inside of my body, which meant escaping my thoughts, but at that time they were indistinguishable.
Every thought was body, and acknowledging any piece of myself was like pressing a seering pan into my head. So now we must emerge from 
this inexplicable (but so societally-crafted) line of thinking and explore 'now', when my body is okay-and I do not need desperately 
to be someone else. 'Now', I imagine myself as a vector in space, only lines crossing lines and true free movement becomes possible again. I MUST 
remember to <b>see out, not in</b>, and in the words of fellow mover (and shaker) Robert Frost, 'that has made all the difference'.

It's 5:30 am and I've already been asked if I was married. I made the age-old mistake of nodding to someone who had nodded to me on the train platform 
while we took our seats, and answered him when he asked me where the plug was for his phone. I should have realized that I was his target from the beginning, but of course
I tried to give him the benefit- pretty soon I was sitting with a knot in my stomach while he stared directly at my downturned face, his scrawny leg splayed out towards me, 
implicitly blocking my escape route. It is in moments like this that I want to go beserk. What I actually say is 'I'm moving', but what I want to say is so much greater. 
Maybe I should have said more, because he came knocking at my new seat a few minutes later, starting with a wave saying 'it's fine' before coming to sit across from me 
again and tell me more about his phone charger. This time I said I wanted to sit alone, to which he suddenly pretended he didn't speak english, or perhaps was so 
shocked that I had actually said it, that I had to repeat myself and say please move, please do not sit here. He gave a look of grave mutual understanding, 'of course', 
and then sat one row back, still facing me, and staring somehow more intensly now with his head bent against the window, his eyes both scared and searching. <br><br>
I've moved a second time, and now the sun is beginning it's peaceful rise, how comforting that cool blue sky comes. I read a short story yesterday, 'the Scarlet Ibis'
recommended by B (who else?), and it did enliven something in me. The story is remarkably short, you could likely read it in a shorter time than this blog entry, but 
hits so intensely, guilt/loss/the strangness of siblings. T is going to be coming to Germany in the next month and it's been lightly on my mind. I'd like to share 
my website with him, perhaps in a misguided try at openness like my mom's shared journal approach, but nonetheless a try.

I have one more thing- I'd like to celebrate how far I've come in the last 3 years with writing, and with general cognitive function, by sharing a poem I wrote 
and TEXTED to D, on Nov 18. 2018. I'm also doing this to celebrate the loss of this cowboy from my psyche, for when I think of him now, I feel less than nothing, 
more like pity. Here goes:
<pre style="font-size:60%">
    The night train is in my head 
    shaking my frizzy hair into my hands 
    my cardboard walls rumble with the gravel 
    as the train rushes through stagnant air 
    screaming hollow notes as 
    though it might arrive 
    suspending me for fear of missing 
    your soft knock 
    on my walls pulsing and 
    trembing to catch 
    my flushed body spread too thin 
    burning halls, fleshy streets, 
    yanking me 
    Back! Back! Here's the train! 
    desperately pressed to jagged walls 
    so thin I know the train will tear 
    right through and you 
    will hear the somber call and 
    you will come 
    But your walls are sturdy, quiet 
    as I send tendrils searching 
    the harsh night 
    for a few light footprints on the moon 
    heard so far between wake and sleep 
    It's only another dull thudding 
    on the tracks 
    My walls are glowing red,
    alarm bells at the station
    but you enter your silent planet 
    and sigh 
    for how wonderful to sleep so soundly 
    indifferent to the symphony next door. 
</pre>
Wow, they really said.. For added context D responded to this saying 'I like this poem. Sorry I never got back to you yesterday'. If I was to revamp this poem now 
there's many words I would change- although I was interested to see my use of 'fleshy streets', a metaphor I used just early this week, 'cracks in the sidewalk/the 
stripes on your backbone'. I guess I wanted to share this since I just called someone else cringe, and it's hard to say that with this skeleton in my closet. I think 
after years of consideration of the <strong>big</strong> question (is it better to have loved and lost?), I always fall on the side of Florence and the Machine <br>
<i> you need your rotten heart, your dazzling pain like diamond rings <br>
    You need to go to war to find material to sing </i> <br>
Although- I'm still not sure what she's actually saying in that song. In any case, while I hate the player (not the game), I think this poem does capture something 
about living in the dorms my freshman year of college. The rampant depth of suffering exerted there - talk about ghosts in the walls - and the complete lack of control 
that I was feeling, which perhaps should have been noticed by a trained professional before it spiraled into ED marble-world a few short years later. With this, 
I'd like to say a soft 'git along lit'l doggy', and move on with my life, thank you for your service, D.

Well, I shared my poetry yesterday- in front of real, alive, people. I'll be honest, I think my words are only meant to be read against a garish 2000's 
colored computer screen, ever-reminding my readers that these sentences are contrived, expected, and could (and maybe should) have been written 25 years ago. I don't think that 
I do well with speaking either, but that would probably be aided if my poems were better. I did like performing 'small talk', since I 
think it warms the audience well to recieve anything else I have half-a-mind to throw at them. In writers' group before the reading we also did 
a small exercise in which we write until our hand hurts (or in my case, got too clammy to hold the pen) and then made a haiku with the resulting 
mish/mash. We all ended up sharing our haiku's at the reading so I will transcribe mine here <br><pre>
Heidelberg, you rap 
scallion - your wings warm and 
open like my page. 
</pre>
I suppose I like it, mostly because I got to teach 40+ german and argentinian people what 'rapscallion' meant. I'd also like to remember the 
building that we used for the reading, called Palais Rischer- a three story, pink builidng standing right in the center of the old city. I 
learned about this building when I went out for drinks with the clarinetist (musician #2), but was mostly just tagging along with F and 
trying to understand if I was having a moment of crippling anxiety or , not. The clarinetist pointed at this grand, pink palace while we were 
outside the neighboring dive bar and told us that he used to live there, that it was an artist collective where 10 lucky, lucky people just 
collaborate- make music, paint, draw, fuck, host parties- to make matters worse, at this exact moment the clarinetist caught sight of a figure 
sitting poised in one of the third floor windows and said 'oh! that's my friend!' At which stunning point he called up to her and she looked down 
at us gracefully, her hair even falling slightly out the window. He asked her if she wanted to join us for drinks and she laughed softly, gave a 
flirtatious and so artistic 'no', and turned back to what I can only imagine was pondering her fucking existance. <br><br>
Heidelberg, you rapscallion. Yesterday I entered the palace for myself, one of those moments that you just know is coming- just not sure what maze 
of decisions will lead you there. It was more organized than I expected, with a large performance space, stage, even wooden chairs stacked against 
the wall. A few artists were sitting in a small courtyard that could be seen through the wide palace windows, and god did they look the part. One 
of them had very close-cut black hair and wide billowing pants that looked unbelievably expensive, I think she was wearing those huge, white 
Balenciaga sandals as well (retailing for 546 â‚¬). She softly lit the candles in the window sills and then popped outside to water a few flowers. I hope 
that I'm telling the truth when I say, I did not envy her. Those sandals are cringe as hell. More broadly- the idea of a artist palace is a bit cringe 
unto itself, I understand the need for such collaborations (similar to the need for some to make harrowing sacrifices working on deadliest-catch style 
Alaskan fishing boats), but utmost broadly: what can you really say about the world when you are living like this? In the same vein as the girl who 
read a poem in response to Rupi Kaur that was really just saying the same words but longer- it's not the type of art I'm into. One of the people in my 
group asked me how Heidelberg could possibly be a 'rapscallion', I said it's funny because it's not.

        <b>TW: My Mom</b>
        <br><br>
I wanted to write about my mom today, I've felt it in the air the last few days, 'tell me about your mom?', 'what is she like?'. I'm often 
filled with - as Howe perfectly put it - 'a cherishing so deep' for my mother, as I think we all feel sometimes. I love to see my mother in me, 
I would love to simply live as her. Maybe there's more to say there. <br><br>
My mother is an alcoholic, but you already knew that. I should say 'was', she wasn't drinking when I went home the last time, but I think that 
'is' is appropriate, seeing as it lingers with us, unsaid and unheard in the fibers of my house. When I decided to talk with L about my mom I 
realized how badly I wanted to relive it all, over and over again just saying the facts and hearing what had happened, making it real so that 
I could know that I had not dreamed it. I wanted to tell her everything, every moment that I had felt that crumbling, that anger, hatred. I wanted 
her to tell me it was fucked up, and she did. She told me she was a child of addiction too, that I could go to Al-Anon, and that I would be 
welcomed. Maybe this isn't the best place to say it all, at the end of the day it's just a story- and in many ways I'm grateful that my mom 
taught me this lesson - that nothing is perfect. A funny thing happens when you tell a story, it is suddenly measured against, 'well how bad was 
it?', 'that's all?'. I know, dearly beloved reader, that you would never think such a thing, but it often happens that I do have those thoughts. That the words
come out and I realize, that's all. <br><br>
My mother's greatest flaw is that she cannot speak with me. She's always known this too, she asked me if I would like to write letters to each 
other when I was a child, so we would write in a book and leave it for each other to read. I love my mother, but how the fuck was a 7 year old supposed to 
write a letter? I wish we had a system like this now, but expectedly after a few weeks the journal disappeared and I believe she 
keeps it hidden in her bedside drawer. I'm sure I would cry if I read those letters now, so it's perhaps for the best that they've been taken 
from me. <br><br>
I often wonder what would happen if I shared my most personal feelings and experiences with my mom. I think she would be hurt, I think she 
would laugh. I wonder if I came here because of this breaking point, to force myself to come to terms with the person I am, the person who is 
so incredibly different from my mother. I grip my idea of her so tightly, wind myself around it and tell myself that I cannot ever show that 
I have turned a corner. I am afraid of showing her how far apart we really are, that I love the thrill of vulnerability, that I want her to know my 
deepest secrets. My mother taught me the pain of dishonesty, of sweeping things so far under the rug that they reach our core, and simmer there. 
I do not ever want to have those moments with you, lovely reader, the moments when my father pretended to be asleep, when my mom scratched at my door and came begging to be let in, only to 
touch my face in cold/clammy fingers and ask me finally in a neauseous slurry 'have you had sex yet?', 'do you hate me?'. The moments I locked her 
in her room, back to the door as she knocked and begged like a child, until the next morning - when she would leave my cereal on the table, 
and we would be filled with that all-encompassing silence, still buzzing in my ears.
<br><br>
I hope you are okay with this, my beautiful and cherished reader- that I must relive these nightmares sometimes. Can you blame me for oversharing? 
When all I ever had to express with was a journal locked by my mother's bed. I hope that you let these memories float right through you, 
like dreams, the way that I do. I buried them into the anger then, kept them sealed in the oddest little memories, the perfect light shine 
of the Heineken bottle that soaked it all up, until that was almost all there was, just pictures of that bottle, always still half-full.

During my ascension/descension I finally got around to changing the website name, since the truth is I chose 'Cyber Hunter' in about 1 second 
(pretend like you didn't already know that). So why <i>STREET TREES</i> ? - personally street trees strike me as these incredible figments of artificiality 
in our daily lives, planted so fucking deliberately, watered and fertilized and cared for to create the perception of nature, where nature already lies. They 
are a perfect idea of nature, the story we create about living harmoniously within the natural world, and god do we cultivate them. Isn't that also the fiction 
of writing? Nature, the events, the reality above the cave has happened, has caused real change in me - and all I can do is view it from this human binary of 
good/bad, wrong/right, nature/infrastructure. What street trees do I decorate my mind with? Lovely and withering and formed into these perfect charactures of what is undoubtedly real, but 
so cloaked in the frality of words and archetypes that they become undoubtedly human.  
<br><br>
Enough pitter/patter I would like to come back to how I am doing. Bad. It saddens me that other languages don't have the rhythmic beauty of 
the phrase 'dull ache of heartbreak', it helps somehow, reminds me that this is so human. I think often when I am in a depressive mood I wish 
that something would happen, like to be finally finished with something- have time for something else- but the last few days it feels like there 
is somehow nothing that I want. There is nothing that I can imagine happening that would shake this feeling, I know that it is simply what 
must pass. It reminds me of being sick, and my mom reminding me that I have to drink water. I'm back to trying to hold the line, follow my rules 
and stick to my routine and I hope that soon things will return to normal. It's funny how memory works huh? How each feeling is really just 
reopening a different feeling, one that happened a long time before.

        <b> This entry is written for me, please be careful wading through and do not read if you are in a vulnerable place, 
            TW: ED</b>
        <br><br>
            I've gone through a period of ascension, and decension, somehow simultaniously. I've relapsed and opened 
            a part of myself that I fight to cover day in/day out, like noticing that a small thing seems to always 
            make you cry. Where this thought took hold and 
            multiplied in my mind I cannot pinpoint, although I have theories. Perhaps it was D, the moment that I 
            fell off the deep end for likely the rest of college, or perhaps 'grew up' is another way of saying that. It 
            may have began with S, someone perhaps equally fleeting and beautiful as the person who has just left me. S 
            was the epitome of unrequited, I wonder if beautiful people feed off of the way that we throw ourselves 
            at their feet. I wonder if S ever believes they are unworthy. It may have been caused by a simple change in 
            scenery. In the fields of rural Washington, the last notes of the suburbs drying up as the roads turn 
            outwards and languish, forgotten as they furrow towards the mountains. In the small town where my grandmother was crowned 
            princess back in the 1940s, where I was torn to shreds (inside) every moment of middle school and then 
            slowly built, carved like marble into an unshakable form. I could understand the rhythm of the people, knew 
            every secret that they told, if you were beautiful there, you were beautiful, there was nowhere else. <br>
            And then one day I left, took my unshakable beauty and catapulted into a city where everyone was noticed, 
            and so noone was. What did I have? It didn't sink in for a while, that I had lost something when I drove away
            from that little glimmering crystal of being someone in a small town. Not only noticed, but treasured, have you ever 
            been told 'you are the most beautiful person I have ever seen'? <br>
            And what does it mean to be beautiful? Held in the eye of you/them/him, someone who reminds you of someone 
            else, someone who you covet. C was exceptionally beautiful, which is what they told me at the bar. I must believe,
            before this pain took hold- freshman year of college when this dark snake wrapped around my unshakable form and laughed when I tried to 
            fight it off, to reach again what lies beneath- that I would have let C go. I would tell myself, 'there will be others, love that they 
            are gone, love that they have taught you something'. But instead I am left speaking with the snake, and it 
            laughs that I would believe C, the absurdity, the audacity that I did not realize that C was lying. That I was 
            so desperate to hear those words I looked past reality, my only reality- the coiled snake. And so the snake binds 
            me to these figures, these stones sinking in my soup, cracking my skull with their smallest word, touch, the thoughts 
            they do not have. The snake is devilish, it doesn't tell me that I am bad, it tells me that I am delusional for thinking 
            I am good. <br><br>
            So no I will not eat, not yet. I am conversing with the snake, for maybe I can make it see reason if I can 
            just hold a bargaining chip, the scrap of control that comes with bodily mutilation. There is so much pain here, for 
            wanting to just have control, to have a body that is beautiful so that I believe it, so that I'm released. But what is 
            beauty? Masculinity, the body that you covet, wanting to remember the fading memory of someone else. Is there 
            anyone out there - another hopeless transmitter drinking cold coffee at 11 am and trying desperately to 
            fix themselves - who would be released if they looked like me? What does it mean to be released, if when I was free 
            I never even knew what this pain felt like. Now that I've left, I know too much to run back. 
            <br><br>
            Ascension. C told me that they are in therapy too, and that the only way to move forward is with brute force. I was in an 
            odd mood of using exclusively platitudes for 3 days, and responded with 'fake it until you make it'. Pain comes heavy on me, 
            souring my recollection, but also there is exhilaration coupled to it- the excitement that I have hit on something. Like when 
            I think about my friends in that little town, and start to cry. C is gone now, and we will likely never speak again. But 
            I have them too, I must remember that. In the forest of my own perception, skewed and upside-down and tinted in a thousand 
            untraceable colors, within the marble, the kafkaesque nightmare/freedom of being the main character of this world. C is gone now, 
            but in the story that I tell myself we could have never met. There is only one thing in this wasteland that I can control, 
            and that is the story I tell. C helped me see the snake, not slaughter it (lanced in viscious and gruesome victory) but feel the 
            weight of it, C was not lying- but beauty is so much more than biology or symmetry or confidence or masculinity- beauty is molding 
            someone to the story we are telling. Cramming them into an archetype/a wish/a dream and soothing ourselves, whispering 'it is real, 
            they are real', taking their ugly fragile body and measuring up, always returning to ourselves, little creatures lost in the thick of it. 
            <br><br> I am not better, I am not soothed but I will eat. Relapse can be such a welcome word, quantifiable, expected, normal, 'everyone 
            relapses at some point', but how much pain has come from this little phrase. Mom, relapsing- or maybe she was never out of it at all, 
            because she seemed to never know when the snake had caught her. 'Fake it until you make it', eat until you are full. The rest will follow 
            if you just stick to the steps, and slowly the inner realm will change, the clouds will clear and you will be happy that you met C.

        <b> I'm afraid I did not sleep </b><br><br>
         I didn't sleep last night, and I forgot what it felt like. I forgot the moment of relief when the sun rises, and you no longer need to worry about what you are 
         doing and where you will end up and how you will get home and if you will get any sleep, because it's all over. I forgot that I used to get high off this feeling. 
         It's been years since I just stayed up a whole night, but I used to do it so often, unbelievably often, it seemed like every night back when I was 17-18. F and I 
         would stay out until my shift began at 4:30 and then I'd sit in the lifeguard chair as the early morning light appeared through the window I faced. And the 
         accomplishment I would feel, knowing that I'd broken the societal rules and gotten away with it. I have more to say but the tiredness just hit me, maybe that's 
         important to say, too. Also I saw a hedgehog and read my last entry aloud to actual people, who am I . 
         <br><br>
         Later that same day: I regret to inform myself that I must now write a 250 word aufgabe (assignment) describing the city of Heidelberg for the ever-emotional 
         Kreativ Schreiben 2. I'm supposed to use the city descriptions we read in class, from the likes of Joseph von Eichendorff, Friedrich Hebbel and the brothers Grimm to
         eloquently and <i>creatively</i> relive my first moments in the town that shines "gleich einer goldenen Krone (like a golden crown)". <br><br>

         My first assignment and translation are linked here for curious little readers:
            <a href="page5.html" target="_self" font-size="100%" font-family="Georgia"> GERMAN TIME </a>

        I think I'm starting to get used to living here, and I no longer feel a drumming anxiety when I go to bed or wake up in the morning. It's more like a sharp bolt 
        that passes right when I start to look at it. Maybe through this art and my time here, I'll be able to begin interrogating the very core themes that I've felt surrounded 
        by since childhood. I'm talking about my fear of being alone, of being isolated. The fear of being left completely abandoned, of having nothing. When I was a child I 
        tried to run away once, I was serious about it too- I wanted to be completely in control for once, to lead my own life probably in a Boxcar Children fantasy. Yet, there has
        always been an unease, like thinking about the life of your aquaintance, the girl you barely knew, and her home, and her room and the people she knew that were all 
        completely normal to her. And she says all the things that she is supposed to, and she talks to all of those people and lives obiediently in her house, but all the while 
        she is trapped there, she could never enter your life, your room, wake up in your bed and survive there. Just like you can never enter hers. This pre-destination terrifies me, 
        that we are all locked in/driven in like nails to a society that we do not even see or understand. I want to be alone, but I'm terrified of losing this thread to reality. 
        What if I did completely unhook my life from these scenes and memories? What if I convinced myself that the bedroom I remembered and the words my grandmother used to say 
        to me had happened to that other girl, that they were never part of me? What could I be, if I was so completely in control? I feel like I'm always playing with this fear, seeing 
        how close I can get to it before it gets too intense, and I fall back to myself again.

        <b> TW: ED </b>
        <br><br>
        Yesterday, I went to a poetry workshop hosted by T, a new friend that I had met the night before at the jazz club (go figure). I'm beginning to feel a bit more connected 
        with the Heidelberg community, and even spoke to a few strangers at the jazz club, unprompted! I suppose I feel proud of the work I'm doing, especially after getting hyped up 
        by my therapist yesterday afternoon- but I know I still have a long way to go. I complained to lovely therapist L that I felt like I had regressed, that I was disappointed that 
        speaking with strangers has gotten progressively more difficult- she validated this and told me that if we could bottle the fearlessness and energy of a child we would be 
        superhuman, that societal messaging tells us we are never good enough, that we are always unworthy and uninteresting. She also reminded me that as I move into ED recovery,
        I will no longer have that as a numbing agent/coping strategy, which can often lead to increased anxiety. This gave me some optimism, since it feels logical/tangible and 
        makes me think my anxiety might even decrease on its own as I become more used to the feelings I had been covering up for the last few years. Not being able to use restriction as a crutch for social 
        anxiety is difficult, in a very direct way that I hadn't fully grasped before. I can no longer convince myself that I must be interesting for people to talk to, because I'm 
        slowly starving myself. Instead, I have to find new and more sustainable ways to convince myself that I'm interesting, like being the judge/jury/executioner of an poorly 
        aligned html website.

            I havenâ€™t been able to write much in the last few days as a friend from many years ago came to stay with me. One of the good parts of growing up is getting to 
            say things like that, 'I haven't seen her in 6 years, I'm excited to meet her again.' F is someone who has inspired me at many points in my life, and laid the groundwork 
            for me being in Germany at all, she's someone I can see myself in- but also the way that German culture has shaped her, and the way American culture shaped me. 
            The last few days F showed me the weaknesses in my anxiety, how resistant I am to speaking with strangers and how uncomfortable I find meeting new people. I think something 
            happened to me in the last few years to cause this, because I think I used to feel excited when I spoke with new people, but now I often feel like something is wrong,
            like I'm saying the wrong thing, like there is a pressure in the air, like I'm starting to disassociate. I feel like I lose the thread of what we are all doing- <br><br>
            What is a conversation supposed to be? When do we know that it has gone well? Or badly? <br><br> F (perhaps seemingly) has none of these thoughts, she has no resistance to 
            walking up to a group of strangers, she'll go door to door in her building meeting her neighbors- and it works - F is rarely alone. She is loved and respected, and she has 
            many people she can call on for help. I still believe that my most precious value is COMMUNITY - yet this outreach process seems so unnatural to me, I feel like I'm 
            making myself jump into cold water, does everyone feel that way? After a few days of watching F work, I felt more confident around people. I walked into my friend's apartment 
            and felt that it did not matter where I stood, what I said, but that nothing would go wrong. I'm sure this confidence will dissipate, but I wonder if it's part of 
            what I'm supposed to learn here. Logically- I know there are a few reasons why my anxiety may have increased in the last few years, I lived through an eating 
            disorder, I felt and named body dysmorphia, I asked to be viewed as queer and non binary, I met people who manipulated me. Even listing these, and having my generalized 
            anxiety diagnosis close to my heart, it's painful to realize that you are no longer as strong as you were before. It's sad to see that your mind is injured, has grown 
            cold and frightened and that as I learned to name these feelings and cope and heal, there were always parts of myself that fell away, I couldn't possibly hold it all.

            Creative Writing </b><br> Yesterday was my first day of creative writing class, held in a thin room on the third floor of an intimidating block of building on the 
            Neckar river bank. How's that for syntax? I sat centered at the back of the class, my back to a oversized glowing window looking out over the river and the CASTLE, 
            how quaint. My teacher was incredibly attractive and I can already tell its going to be a long term. The class reminds me of being in my sophomore year english class.
            We work on creating more complex sentences and building feeling, not simply stringing facts together. It's funny to me that I struggle with this so much while 
            writing in German. In our first exercise, I wrote 5 sentences about what I had done yesterday, translated they read "I went to University Place at noon. / I ate a pretzel with 
            cheese. / I met with my friends. / We talked about our day at school. / I went home and was asleep by eleven." My friends shared their sentences and I immidiately 
            realized that my pretzel story was unbelievably lifeless. My hot professor corrected my sentences and said nothing about them, although he had made a cutting remark about German 
            level when the class started (letting us know that if you happened to be an A2 level (my placement score) there was no shame in switching to the easier class as they still had 
            spots available). I can tell that this class is going to be emotionally difficult for me, as one tiny hot professor telling me I can't write could seal my fate and spell the end 
            of Cyber Hunter altogether. Perhaps I should start providing translations of my blog posts, although I'm guessing my posts would decrease in complexity and length until I'm writing 
            to you all about pretzels and cheese exclusively. 
            <br> On a more global scale- what does it mean to be bad at your passion? And what is a passion anyway? I often wonder if I got the idea that I could write from my second-grade 
            teacher, who asked us to write a creative story- the results of which were surprisingly similar to what I produced in my current class -I actually remember exactly what I wrote, 
            it's only one sentence hanging on the wall in my mom-mom's house. It is exerpted here in it's entirety: 
            <br><br><i> 'I love the seaweed' said Trevor, a ten-year-old boy, as we swam deeper into the dark secrets of the sea.</i>
            <br><br> From my scattered memory, I had fully intended to complete the assignment and continue my fan-fic style deep sea adventure, but my teacher liked my first sentence so 
            much that she gave me an alternate assignment, coloring a special page with my sentence as a gift for my mom-mom. That small action conviced me that I had potential as a writer, a thought 
            so fragile yet persuasive that it still occurs to me as I sit against the window in kreative schreiben 2. Maybe one of the sentences I'll write here will have the same 
            draw as my second-grade sea shanty, and I'll finally make it big- but I'm guessing there's a bit more to it than that.

    Anxieties : Today I want to investigate this word, as today has been an anxious one for me. On a etymological level, I love the 'x' in anxiety, it captures a feeling
    of unease but also of uniqueness, what would our lives be if we were never afraid? 
<br><br> My anxieties have become a bit more managable, after learning to see the steps that lead me to these feelings, I'm more able to rationalize that they are only manifestations
of deeper questions that ground my life. I often feel anxious when I feel that I am taking the "easy" way in my life, that I'm not steering true to myself. Today I knew that I would 
feel anxious, as I was sleeping most of the day after staying out most of the night. Even rationalizing this decision to stay late at the Mannheim club, since I knew that experiencing
the late night club scene was more important to me than a well-rested Sunday, I still experienced self loathing and fear today. Drinking adds to my anxiety as well, for many 
obvious reasons, too straightforward to bother mentioning. I think I'm deeply afraid of who I am becoming, as though my body and self were a runaway train- and as my microscopic decisions 
build myself- every tiny moment becomes integral to me. me being me constantly. me never letting myself drop, because what if I'm really not that great? It quickly becomes too big, 
there is no self and there is only a collection of every moment that the people in my life share with me. I was only me to the people in the club last night, and when I saw noone today, I was effectively 
erased for those many hours. More than that, my interactions that define me aren't even mine, they exist only how they are percieved by the other. My therapist would respond to this (speaking of 
the self being kept in the other) by asking me to consider my core values and beliefs, those that exist regardless of my small daily decisions. It doesn't need to get so big, I can simply value 
community, value love, and the decisions I make will always align with that in some twisted way. Of course I can act unethically, but I am acting as myself and following 
these guiding values, and when I make mistakes I am acting as someone who values love, and the mistakes that come with that.

<br> And so another day begins, I can tell this is going to be a slow one, Iâ€™ve already spent most of the morning working on the site. Iâ€™d like to do more today 
but maybe this is enough. Itâ€™s interesting the things we value in our day, and the things that feel like wasted time. 
<br> I spent about 3 hours this morning creating a flower border, which felt a bit meaninglessâ€”and yet I would work 3 hours at the lab washing glass wear, 
and feel fulfilled. I think the question comes down to what will pay off, and what time will be forgotten about. When I was in 5th grade I would stay in from
recess every day to work on my wix.com class website...and look at me now. More broadly, thereâ€™s the question of my intentions for the dayâ€”how do I want to 
feel at the end of it? Perhaps I should be one of those people who meditates, because I often feel like this question causes me anxiety that is never resolved. 
Maybe someday Iâ€™ll even be like that activist who set himself on fire (an anecdote Iâ€™m sure will soon be lost to time). I think Iâ€™m feeling like I havenâ€™t fully 
taken advantage of my "time in Germany" today, but isnâ€™t it funny how that anxiety just further detracts from my time here? Maybe if I do some Duolingo 
Iâ€™ll feel better.

It's sunny today, and I can't see what I'm typing due to the glare on my computer screen. Today I worked on connecting CSS to my existing code so that I can make more
complex pages, namely add a flower border to my poems page. I was inspired by B to give my site a bit more of a narrative structure, so that you feel a bit more guided through
the (cyber) space. An artist that I greatly admire (M) posted a book excerpt yesterday that resonated with me. It was setting a scene in great detail, describing a landscape rebuilding after a flood. 
I wish that I could write a book in which I just establish scenes and settings. Perhaps there's more room for poetic liberty when describing a scene, since some places can feel truly magical or dreamlike, 
even in our daily lives. 
<br> I'm on the train now, facing backwards as I'm pulled through the warm countryside. A bee landed on the smooth plastic at my elbow and I watched it until it flew away. 
My neighbors on the train seem sleepy and subdued in the mid-afternoon sun, as though they are resigned to the hot summer months ahead of us. There is a breeze now, and coolness in the purple 
rocks where the lizards live. We enter each village like a snake in the grass, surfacing long enough to steal a few weary passengers before diving back in the cool, green meadows.

<br>Today was my first day of German school. The google translate extension on my computer translates the name of my class to 'Mermaids, Robbers, and Gold-Diggers: 18th-19th 
Century Ballads' which I think may be a slight mistranslation but I appreciate the ambiguity of "Gold-Diggers". One thing about Germany is their doors, they are ridiculous. I get nervous
enough walking into unknown buildings searching for my class on the first day, I can't also be faced with opening giant wooden doors that look like they haven't moved since the pre-industrial era. 
My professor was nice though, and smiled at me after I stumbled through my three sentence presentation on types of metaphorical (nicht nur topographical) boundaries in ballads. This was 
a few minutes after I had to reveal to the class that I could not name one (1) single German ballad. Luckily I wasn't the only one. Later I realized that almost all of the German texts I had 
read last term for German literature were, in fact, ballads. We live and we learn.

<br>It's the start of a new week, and my laundry is in the dryer. Highlights from the last weekend include but are not limited to: <br>
 - Getting a tour of Heidelberg and solidfying (by who's metric?) my first new german friend. L graciously led me through the Philosophenweg (Philosopher's Walk) and taught me 
 the German word for bug (KÃ¤fer). We met a comically deshelved (one-eyed) man in the marktplatz who was selling old newspapers and his own paintings. I bring this up because if 
 there was ever a character worth commiting to text, it was him. During the hour that he talked with us he had to run off twice to retrieve prints and at one point his STRAW HAT that had blown
 away. He asked me if I wanted his card at one point and I accepted, thinking it would be a quick business card transaction. Actually, he took out a post card and began writing his name (Beppo), 
 email, phone number, and then giving me an unending list of media recommendations beginning with the name of the french art dealer 'Ambroise Vollard', and ending with his favorite NPR 
 tiny desk concerts. During this music discussion it was discovered that we had actually both been at the same jazz club last Tuesday for the open jam session, so that bound us in a 
 very quaint and special way. As much as he talked, I'm very much hoping to see him there again tomorrow. Some characters just write themselves.  
<br> <br>
- Yesterday Q and E travelled with me to Stuttgart for the FrÃ¼hlingsfest (spring festival). I think we were all expecting some sort of flower-filled street fair with spring 
baskets carefully crafted by local artists. Actually it was a carnival, with a slight Vegas theme. Howeverâ€”for reasons that I probably need to explore more in therapyâ€”I felt 
great the whole day. It was like living without anxiety, and feeling consistently at peace with the world around me. I caught myself just feeling content, and in the mood that makes me say that 
everything feels like a dream. If I had a bullet journal, yesterday's square would have been bright green. Maybe someday I'll be able to isolate the steps to that feeling, but for now I'm 
just happy to feel it.

<br>We made it to entry 2! <br> Today has been a day, I've drank a lot of coffee and ventured to the store for brezeln (pretzels) and a bag of mixed wafer cookies that turned out to be 
delicious. I've been enjoying trying new food here, since I have a tendency to only eat my 15 safe foods back in 'the states'. I think for my second entry I want to have a 
take, just to start exploring the range of expression a blog can provide. I have a <strong> lot </strong> of ideas for my site, and more occuring by the day. Yesterday
I entertained having a page dedicated to the bugs I find, and today I realized that I could create a page where I review every forensic files episode that I watch. The concept
of having a highly niche passion that no other person cares about or engages with is in a word, exquisite. I think that may be true passion and perhaps even 
what it means to be human. All that to say, my take is actually about LA musicians. If Seattle is grunge, LA is jazz flute. I think that's all I have to say for the moment.

<br>Welcome to my world, <br>
I've wanted to make my own website for a long time. One of my favorite authors has a website that she writes on every day, she even publishes a book every 
few years with the entries. I have two of her books, and I like that some days she writes multiple pages and other days she writes a single word, or just a title. 
I've been inside a lot the last two days, but it's felt nice. I can finally make a place to put my thoughts, and I like that it's completely mine. I also enjoy the
format of writing within Visual Studio Code; it makes my words come out in pretty colors and tries to autocorrect my poetry with programming commands. I've been 
trying for years to find the perfect notebook or format to make myself write. I'm sure this isn't it, but I like it for now. 
<br>
Today I woke up late and spent a few hours adjusting the site. I've been so pleased with how all of the coding has turned out. I know it isn't perfect,
and I think I'm doing a few things wrong, but I feel like it looks authentic to how I wanted it, and how often does that happen? Eventually I got on the 
bus and bought some household items (can opener, thread, notebooks) and even found some leather pants that have been on my list. All was going exactly to plan
until I got on the wrong bus going home and ended up seeing a bit more of the city than I had wanted. That's mostly how my days go here, I sit on the bus and 
think, or try and listen to the other passengers and identify the words on posters and billboards. It's lonely, and pleasant, and different for me. 
I didn't eat great today, better luck tomorrow.
