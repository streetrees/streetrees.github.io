Oh Lucy, Lucy 
<br>through the house 
<br>and to the tree. 
<br>
<br>Oh Lucy, Lucy
<br> that night lyin' 
<br> in the empty street 
<br>
<br>Oh, Lucy, Lucy 
<br>my baby still
<br>waiting there for me. 

<br><br>
<br><br>

You knew the time was right in that old house when the clock would stop chiming. All the way up 'til 3, I'd listen as long clangs ring through the 
wooden hallways, even every fifteen minutes, until three - when there would be an unruly silence. The clock chimed so loud it would wake you up sometimes, 
or more often make you aware of the sounds of the house while your half-closed eyes looked up at the ceiling. I always figured the break in the chime was the 
perfect window - the 2:45 bell would sound heavy up the hall and I'd wait until I was sure the quiet had gone too long, then I would leave. 
<br><br>
Of course, the 3 am silence also presented a problem. As the clock was reseting or recalibrating or doing whatever it did during this thirty minute window I 
would quietly change my clothes, brush my teeth, pack my bag, and shuffle down the hall, all keeping below the sound of the wind that shuttered against the windows 
that time of night. Of course, I stepped wrong sometimes - cracking the board in the floor and sending what I considered shock waves through the house. To be honest, 
this happened almost every time. I'd freeze and watch for the door at the end of the hall to begin to curve inward, sucking the air around it into the black 
hole of that room, but it always stayed shut - just wavering lightly in the reverberations of the wind. I always used the back door, the exit farthest from that room, 
and waited until the clock resumed its chime, 3:15, to time the metalic closing of the screen door in it's frame with the dry call of the bell. I never figured out 
what made the clock stop chiming. 
<br><br>
Once outside - I would run to the road, checking behind me to see if the light would turn on, the stale porch light as my mom went to see who was walking out on the 
creaky wooden steps. Or, the light in the room - perhaps it would be a faint glow from the bedside light as dad rolled over, switched it and listened for the 
ticking of the clock - how quiet was it really? 
<br><br> 
But tonight, the house stayed dark. 
<br><br>
I crept down the gravel road, the stars burned hot above and I listened to the wind stir the trees along my path. The leaves breathed in and out with me, big round 
trees moving like sea anenomies as their leaves twisted and turned. I passed by the old cabin that belonged to Mrs Ethel, turning just in time to see the light of 
the moon reflect it's perfect shape in the upstairs window. Rough red timbers tore open the sides of the house and it seemed to melt into the stirring leaves, a lonely 
ghost. Would be nice to see around those old rooms sometime, to see what sorts of memorites are still strewn around the floral seat cushions and chipped eucalptus 
vases. I wonder how many of my things are still there? 
<br><br>
When I met George that night he was swinging on the frayed rope in front of the school house. Red blisters had began to form beneath the skin, bursting white 
bubbles onto his palms which he showed me when I came up, 
<br><br>
I thought you weren't coming tonight, he said as I took his welted hand and looked at the white petals of skin glow in the moonlight. 
<br><br>
I almost didn't come, especially with the storm tonight, I thought you probably wouldn't either. 
<br><br>
I always come. I like seeing you, Ken. 
<br><br>
I didn't take my fingers from his hand, trying to feel my way around his emotion through the callouses of his palm. 
He kicked his shoe into the sand beneath the swing and flinched, his hand moving deftly to the safety of the seam of his jeans. I avoided his eyes, 
just shuffled my own shoes deeper into the dark sand. Around us, dust swept around the schoolyard illuminated by the single beam of the playground light, 
a dingey yellow box that had teetered there on the slanted wood post forever.  
<br><br>
That night was like most of 'em, we walked through the gravel streets and talked about the many figments asleep in their houses, looking in the 
battered windows and shaking our heads at the strange novelties strung up on their porches, wooden birds of all sizes - menageries of carved mice, 
cats, tattered flags buffeted against the railings, signs of all sorts hung and slumped against the door, 'We All Die Together', or 'Long Live Liberty'.
