            Intuition. 
            <br><br>
I should have never walked down that road. I should have never let us stand at the edge of the grass and then take the last step, I should have pulled you back to 
the car and driven us far away.  
<br><br>
I knew it at the time, you know that I did, too. I heard you laughing when you saw that I was scared, I heard you whisper that everything was going to 
be alright. And now look where we are. Look who should have listened. 
<br><br>
The second that we crossed the threshold we were gone, and now I'm alone, waiting for your voice in the darkness.

                Two steps forward, one step back. The building was gutted when we came in. Just the cold concrete and tags all over the walls, we thought everything had 
                already been taken. It was the middle of summer then, so hot that the floor stuck to our shoes, and you thought we could get right to work. Saddle up on the 
                hot slab and you'd just take a minute with me, just a moment of the hot summer day to touch me and tell me that things could be different, that I could 
                be with you. 
                <br><br>
                How terribly empty that old building was, cavernous, and echoing, and when my back slapped on to the ground it sizzled and rats heard us on every floor. 
                Windows that showed us nothing, just empty white sky that just felt like another room, over and over, I gripped you to try and tell you to stay, 
                but you always had another trick.
