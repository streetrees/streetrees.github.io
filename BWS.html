                                                            I went to an insect dealer in Neukölln. It said it was actually a reptile feed store online but I 
                                                            thought they might have what I was looking for.

                                                            I walked in the door marked 'Insekten Laden' with a paper sign and ran into a large man standing 
                                                            in the narrow hallway. It felt a bit like being in my dad's shed. I tried to explain to the man what I 
                                                            wanted but he only pointed to a square hole in the floor. A wooden ladder was nailed to the wall 
                                                            and disappeared into the yellow hole.

                                                            in giant glass bulbs at the back of the store. Nearby were stacked boxes of lab mice huddled 
                                                            and clawing at the glass.

                                                            I squish the plastic box into my bag, the blister closure on the top makes a cracking sound 
                                                            against my laptop and my notebooks. I get on the bus, then the subway, listening for the 
                                                            exoskeletons and the soft swishing of the sawdust as they climb over each other.

                                                            the package, holding a female the size of my thumb and letting her run through my fingers, 
                                                            carefully passing her between my hands as the others climb up the open walls of the container, 
                                                            when they reach the top I place the old roach back in the box and pick up the new one, we play 
                                                            like this, circling each other, like cat’s cradle, or shuffling cards.

                                                            At some point, it's time to kill the roaches. I take the isopropyl alcohol from the pharmacy out of 
                                                            my bag and dab it on some tissue paper, then lay it down in an airtight Tupperware to create a makeshift killing jar.

                                                            I gently pick up each roach one by one, shaking off the sawdust, and when 
                                                            all 10 are in the box I close the lid and let them crawl over the poison fibers.

                                                            That night I dream I'm at her parent’s house. I've brought the box of cockroaches, but they are 
                                                            still alive, climbing around in my bag. As we lay wrapped in each other on the bed I watch a 
                                                            roach the size of my fingernail disappear between the mattress and the bed frame. I pull up the 
                                                            sheet and see more roaches escaping under the mattress. They've bred. I slip out and open my 
                                                            bag to check the roach box, the plastic closure is shoved thick with tiny roaches, their legs 
                                                            steadily pushing them under the lid, leaking out like a liquid.

                                                            As she sleeps, I move around the bed, pulling the roaches from their hiding places in the dark 
                                                            corners of the sheets, I pluck them pushing and scrambling to escape, until I have a handful. 
                                                            Then I go to the kitchen and pour them into a glass of Glühwein, hoping they won't be 
                                                            discovered. Unfortunately, her mother was up preparing the Christmas ham, and it was her

                                                            down the kitchen sink, running the water and nudging them down the drain with my fingers.
