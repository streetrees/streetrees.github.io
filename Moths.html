One night, I came out through the wood. Hardened and cracked open, salt wings flaking off, moving to other towns 
<br><br>
Falling down like fiberglass from the rafters, 
<br><br>
Wedged between the slats, in an orange forest speckled and alive with stone columns 
<br><br>
Faraway light could be heard, harsh over fields and parking lots 
<br><br>
Sounds of dusk, forks scraping on plates 
<br><br>
I talked to the night too, as the doors were closing 
<br><br>
Watching behind the smoke stacks and wondering 
<br><br>
Are you asleep now? on the pull-out couch,
<br><br>
Bottles tumbling down the road, your breath slowly with the cars 
<br><br><br><br>
When I found you on the bank of the river, <br>
My skin was soft, and I often said the wrong thing 
<br><br>
One night I slipped on the wet bank, and was carried with the water down the ridge <br>
Spinning into the cold trees laid across the river, caught in the branches beneath the current, it was not dark but instead blood white, a flashlight flickering on above my eyelids. 
<br><br><br><br>
But that isn’t really what happened, I watched you ahead of me, watched as you slipped and were gone, then only white foam, the water clamoring for you. 
<br><br>
I went after you, but now I also lay beneath the sound of the water, listening as it rushed over me. 
<br><br>
You are gone now, but nothing is missing 
<br><br>
Coming into you, I thought you were a room 
<br><br>
You just weren’t 
<br><br>
I move through a wet wall.
