<b>TW: ED</b><br><br>
I want to give it up to my biggest inspirition for this blog, miss Issy Wood. It must have been about two years ago now that I discovered 
Issy Wood the summer that COVID was beginning to pick up. I was getting into podcasts at the time (how far I would fall), and was 
listening to the radio show that Billie Eilish produced with her dad. They actually introduced me to a lot of great bands and music but 
by far the most influential was their choice to include Issy Wood's song <i>Soup</i>. I immidiately loved issy's very 
soft and careful vocals, although I now hardly listen to the song due to the fact that it is incredibly repetitive and lyrically dogshit. 
However, I realized that I was on the wave with something, and very quickly became obsessed. It was by far the most extreme parasocial relationship 
I have had to date. 
I dove completely into Issy Wood, her paintings, her blog, her music, I bought her book (a collection of about 1 year of blog entries) the same day that I discovered her. 
<br><br>I now own two of her books and I don't think that I would be typing this today if it was not for her. I love that her writing 
is amateurish enough that I can see myself in it, and she doesn't take it too seriously- just words she likes and documenting the way 
that the world warps around her. To return to the songs of hers that I actually do cherish and listen to:
<br><br>
ALL 4S: I used to listen to this song while I was driving everywhere back in 2020, and damn it was relevant, the anxiety and the 
dialogue of this song was exactly what was playing in my own head at this time. <br><br>
<i>I'm just waiting 'til you really get me off </i> <br>
<i> I know my body's not quite what you thought </i> <br> 
<i> I'm still showing my love by getting on all fours </i> <br> <br>
Issy Wood has written extensively about her ED and I felt conforted and extremely drawn to this song during the depths of my own. She sings 
her heartbreaking inner monologue, which in company with the beauty of the song and her voice works to prove the incongruence of her anxieties 
about herself <i>I'm just waiting 'til you tell me to get lost</i>. The animal "all fours" spoke to me in 
particular since I was so disconnected from my body during this time, and I felt as though I no longer even understood how people behave, hold their 
bodies, or viewed me as I undressed. Yet still, she "shows her love", goes through the imaginined motions and stays pressed to the 
edge of this shared understanding of sex, nakedness and how she is being percieved. Intimacy has lost it's emotional meaning and all that 
remains is the strange movements of her body. 
<br><br>
METAL/DIARY: Did I get my habit of writing things in slash/form from Issy Wood? Probably. I just want to showcase this song because 
I think it's the strongest sound-wise, yes, admittedly all Issy Wood songs sound basically identical but this one has been on my mind 
for the last year. The lyrics are extremely literal and speak to me so , clearly. <br><br>
<i> There's not a part of me I don't hate</i> <br>
<i> Wish I was just a slice of empty space </i> <br>
<i> And now my stomach muscles always ache </i> <br>
<i> For when I screamed all day </i> <br><br>
Obviously, there is a quite literal reference to ED at play, but I'm also drawn to the pain of this ED portrayal. The numbing of the ED 
to escape 'when she screamed all day'. I also did a lot of work with lovely L to understand some of the reasons for my own ED, coming down 
mostly to that 'slice of empty space', the worthliness that Issy speaks so often and unabashedly about. The title, 'Metal/Diary' 
is in my mind, an obvious reference to self-harm, a reminder that every action that we take is only another way of coping. 
<br><br>
DAUGHTERPROOF: I wanted to include a song from Issy's new album because it's more of the same but in such a welcome way. If there wasn't 
enough similarities between us in our parasocial hell, Issy has mom issues too. This song burns so slow but damn she says it all- 
the million mile high wall between her mother's perception and Issy's true feelings, <br><br>
<i> Just know I'm gonna be fine</i><br>
<i> I'm too happy</i><br>
<i> But if I wake up calling your name I </i><br>
<i> Wonder if you'd hear</i><br><br>
Closing thoughts: Sometimes you find an artist that just seems to be saying exactly what you're thinking and Issy does all of that while 
having a cool base and a beautiful voice. I'm linking Issy's blog [ I'm not linking because the blog is now deactivated :( ]

at the risk that you will discover how much I've stolen from her
(using letters instead of names: genius). <br><br>

I was planning on reviewing a completely different album tonight before I was informed that Metric had released a new single, which I hastily listened to 
multiple times while purchasing tickets to their Portland show this October. <br><br>
<i>All Comes Crashing</i> felt especially pertinent to me as I've been watching a lot of the YT creator Herbs and Alters lately, such as a 40 minute video on the tragic 
death/disappearance of the lead singer of Manic Street Preachers I watched shortly before my first listen of this song. Herbs and Alters specializes in stories about their addictions and the early 2000's club/alt scene which this song 
feels aligned with. The title itself could be the title of one of Dorian's videos, and many of the lyrics remind me of their depictions of chaotic, stifling raves in the 
early aughts, <br><br> 
<i> This might be my last night / that's how it goes, there's no one / I would rather be lying beside </i> <br><br>
<i> We'll come crashing down together / Don't expect to live forever </i><br><br>
If these lyrics seem simplistic to you, they are. What I love about this song is imagining Emily writing it about her own 90s-00s club nostalgia and revisiting her 
teenage emotions/longing/pain as an adult. I never got the honor of going to a rave in the early 2000's but I feel like this song would be welcome there. 
<br><br> Regardless of my interpretation- this song is a banger and I'm thrilled to think that I'll be listening to it live later this year. The guitar riff makes it difficult 
for me to stop listening as it reaches a climax right as the song ends, forcing me to continuously replay (I've listened over 15 times at this point), Emily's voice is 
astounding to me- of course I can hear the Metric in her voice but this song has a more pop/futuristic sound than I've heard from her before. I'll admit that the chorus 
reminds me of Major Lazer's similar banger <i>Lean On</i>, not at all in a bad way. The song has a palpitable electo-pop essence that I'm elated that the band has returned to 
especially with a more powerful/less naive coherence than their last truly electronic album, <i>Synthetica</i>. 
<br>
Overall, <i>All Comes Crashing</i> does exactly what a single should, in the same vein as what PTM's <i>Feel It Still</i> accomplished back in 2017. The song makes me incredibly 
hyped for the new album and reminds me that Metric knows what the fuck they're doing. I predict a great radio reception for this song, even larger than the hestant adoption of 
<i>Help I'm Alive</i> by every alternative station in the last ten years. I'm also hoping the upcoming album <i>Formentera</i> keeps up with the single's pop energy maybe even 
... if we're lucky ... returning to some of the more psychadelic themes and lyrics of their first album. As of now, the rock and electronic balance appears to have reached 
a rare space of perfection for Metric, lets see if they can keep it that way.

                <th style="color:green; font-size:15px; text-align: left;">
I can't imagine starting my album review page with anything other than my most listened to album of this year (including almost all of my most played songs);
<i>The Dream</i>.  
<br><br> THE ARTWORK: The cover of the dream captivated me the day they pre-released 'Get Better' last November. It features a humanoid (perhaps futuristic? or alien?) figure, a 
diversion from past album covers which have gradually become more representational. <i>The Dream</i> is the first time that we can interpret the way
that alt-J sees themselves, and the expression of bliss (like rain) falling over us as we listen. The name and title font/placement are reminiscent of late 90's electronic albums (I'm thinking
larely of the cover of Zero 7's <i>Simple Things</i>). This is the first album to have alt-J written on the cover, giving the album a sense of professionalism and perhaps 
experience. As alt-J moves towards a more typical story-telling approach, this cover implies a more cohesive and recognizable album format, in the ranks of the early electronic 
bands that likely inspired it. 
<br><br> 
BANE: To be honest this song loses me, especially the snap, crackle, pop at the beginning. I bet you thought this was going to be a puff piece- actually I find the themes and sounds 
in this song tacky. The overly contrived comparison of marketing/addiction to fizzy cola opens <i>The Dream </i> in a shallow and simplistic way at odds with the later tone of 
the album.   
<br><br> U&ME: Fun and fresh beats, this song may as well be mid-timeline Glass Animals. It's vaguely easy to listen to and has a soothing, crackling backbone that was immidiately 
enticing when it was released last year. I appreciated the foray into more a toned-down accoustic sound (later mirrored in the accoustic EP released after the album). 
<br><br> HARD DRIVE GOLD: The novelty of alt-J creating art about such a timely topic as crypto currency is not enough to save this song. 
<br><br> HAPPIER..: The initial falling beats of this song are where <i>The Dream</i> truly grabs me. I've started listening to the album from this song, as I believe it to be
the turning point of when alt-J hits their archetypal and infintely-indecipherable rhythm. <i>'the smell of burning cattle'</i> accompanied by the light crackling effects creates 
a wonderful and mysterious soundscape I continue to explore. 
<br><br> THE ACTOR: Beep/Boop/Bop the most accessible song on the album, destined for a Breaking Bad style cook scene. I've never known alt-J to open up so personally, and the 
bright notes conceal the pain of this song.
<br><br> GET BETTER: At a few points, this song has made me cry. Most of the time, I skip it immidiately. <i>'meeting at the serpentine/I am yours/you are mine'</i> is one of my favorite lines of the album, 
the rest of the song, however, seems to lose itself. This song has also received more of my scrutiny, since it was released early and the only scrap of the album I had for over 6 months.  
I hypothesize (due to a comment overheard on tour that implied alt-J themselves no longer remembered the words to this song) that this was written deep in the throws of quarantine. If so, can we judge the slowly 
meandering and overly poignant (front-line workers, bread baking) too harshly? 
<br><br> CHICAGO: Here we enter the realm of where I can no longer convey my thoughts on alt-J's artistry. A perfect song, the melody makes my skin crawl. And the perfect 
preface to Philadelphia's climax. 
<br><br> PHILADELPHIA: The crecendo of <i>The Dream</i>. If you didn't like the quaint english chorus, you're like everyone else and I'd encourage you to listen again. It's 
a risk, challenging and although I have moments of hating it, I believe it largely works. 
<br><br> WALK A MILE: My favorite song on <i>The Dream</i>, a beautiful and accessible beat that accompanies Joe's voice masterfully. There is a twang here, truly bluesy, and 
we can finally hear what it would be like if alt-J played a washboard during prohibition. Lyrically, this song strikes the best balance of vagueness and certain specificity 
that I'm sure someone out there understands intimately. Makes me feel like I'm wandering in the desert (Vince Gilligan take note of this one as well).
<br><br> DELTA: A welcome nod to alt-J's roots. Reminiscent of Ripe and Ruin, glad to know that they still do whatever they want. 
<br><br> LOSING MY MIND: This song feels as if it should be wide-open to me as Chicago/Philidelphia but remains somewhat more closed. I'm not sure if this is to do with the 
lyrics or my own lived experience, but I find it difficult to get inside and feel close to. I may be putting too much pressure on it, due to what I assume is it's attention to
queerness, gender and germans for some reason. 
<br>
<mark>UPDATE</mark> I know now that time is a circle and that god moves in waves, this song was not meant to be digestible to me until 
this date, and now it is the most powerful song on the album. I understand each note and word intimately and excruciatingly. I'm sorry 
everyone but...alt-J might 
be the messiah. 
<br><br> POWDERS: A fitting goodbye, this song lowers me down and sends me away to the rest of my life, slowly reminding my body that I must again listen to something other 
than <i>The Dream</i>. When I first heard this song I knew that it was the final song on the album, which I think conveys the strength of the story-telling in the melody. 
The mall sounds work sometimes, although I generally find they pull me away from the album. I wonder if they included them to balance the beginning of Bane, and if so, 
perhaps should have chosen as less-is-more approach. On the other hand, perhaps pulling me from the album is okay- as all good things must end.
