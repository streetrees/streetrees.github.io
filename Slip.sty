Slip


watched their forms slip from the 
buildings across the way, 

let me slip past your hands and hold you tenderly 

there was always ice on the road and you'd tell me not to slip, 

We cannot slip through with our
hands clenched so tight 

'your clock has stopped' Seowon 
points out, 'it always does that', an hour later Seowon screams as the hands run forward on their own, slipping down from twelve to three, I had 
said I thought about things like fractals, but I don't really know, I stopped talking somewhere back and was only listening, I said, 'that's really 
really scary' Seowon looked right at me and said 'Oh, you don't look real anymore', then I didn't. 

In the shower, I pull my own body from the backdrop, my shoulders slipping through the air as it parts for my skin, 

When I realize I'm there I'm 
trying to softly course correct, like slipping a paddle into the water.

Answer comes from far away, answer falls silent on the line a mile back, vibration slipping down so soft it falls from the chain and is lost 
among the rocks. 

I think they sent a slip to my class, 

blue slip on sneakers leaving dirt on the stiff grey carpet.

I quietly slip out and open my bag to check the roach box, 

I slipped in my socks and slammed my head into the corner of the wall. 

in the snow my tires would slip in the ice and we'd scream and laugh, 

I slipped from the room, from his mind that night, through the window, my real body, hard and made of metal,

crawl on towards the place without control, 
slip my own hands behind my back, 
blindfold my own eyes, 

Dilemma, I stroke the dilemma, spread my thighs and slip my hand down the skin like a knife in butter,

slippers on tile 
shoulders bent over 
I knew from your voice 
when you'd crossed over 

their arms pulling in and the barbs slipping down, her fingers, wet and smooth like theirs, shoving open the steel door
and soon 

the water remains only a velvet covered bed, one could walk on it's belly, the soft back of a cat, 
one can slip into it's wet mouth, 

we took a little plastic 
fish and cut slits in the pages of our book so the fish could slip through them, to visit the sand, the seaweed, moving through the book itself 

where was the fish going? as it slipped through the pages?

eels leave the water and move over land, they slip in black masses over the ground and find new pools,

the eels slip over land while we cannot see,

we slip ourselves under what we believe is their skin and try to empathize, imitating their calls
