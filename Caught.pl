Caught 

I'm hiding in a woodpile when I'm caught, the woman takes my arm and leads me to a man with a chop saw blade,
the other people who've been caught just wait in line,
I caught the dragonfly floating on the surface, it was limp, and full of water.  
I was completely caught off guard
it's yellow and smudged and I caught it
Maybe I simply caught you at a bad time,
caught in a hurricane.
caught in the February wind
like I was caught in a trap and was wriggling to get out.
caught a glimpse through the front window
his car caught on fire within seconds


when I can't catch my bus even though it's passed twice,
turning it's branches and catching all the air,
and nothing catches you surprised 
catching on the windows and staying insects between the panes
I really can't catch a break.
it's time to check the catch,
eventually catching him a few blocks down at a bus stop, where I cornered him,
running down to the stream to catch the crane flies
