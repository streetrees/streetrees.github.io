        <b>Peterson Family Christmas Card, mailed December 1. 1999 </b>
        <br><br>
        Dear Family Near and Far,
        <br><br>
        It has been truly a stand-out year for the Peterson family. Jen and I have been blessed with so much love and support from all of you as 
        we prepare to welcome our wonderful baby girl, Johanna, this February. This year was full of bright moments, starting with our trip to the east coast 
        in June to celebrate Bradley's graduation from NYU. We were so lucky to be able to spend 5 days with the entire Fiddler family; John, Anne, Brian, 
        and Bradley of course. We were so grateful to have be there to watch Bradley walk across the stage and recieve his diploma, then get to visit some 
        beautiful places in NYC like the Statue of Liberty and Times Square, stopping at some amazing restauants along the way!

        Johanna school trip Wednesday, pack lunch 
<br><br>
        I was walking through a long, dark hallway and I could see a glow coming from a light at the end. As I walked the tunnel began to turn and I was 
        suddenly walking on the wall, then the ceiling, I turned a corner and came out into the living room, everything was very clean and neat but when I 
        looked closer there was a bright red spot on the carpet, the spot was Johanna, crying, and the skin on her arms and legs was lacerated, I 
        went to her immidiately but when I got there she was gone and in her place was the blue plastic tub for her toys. Then the family was coming into the 
        room; Markus and Zach, and I think my parents, too, but their faces were blurred, and then I was looking outside, watching the sun rise, and I felt calm somehow.

<br><br>
I'm feeling really good today! Everything has been going really well at school and at my after school activities too. I saw Celeste after 
school yesterday and we walked together to the park, then we bought ice cream from the 7/11 and we ate it there, it was so fun! Celeste said that 
she wanted to get a dog and I really hope that she does because then maybe we could walk it together. Today at school when I turned in my assignment 
Mrs. Carlson said that she really liked my writing and that I 'had a knack for it'. I couldn't believe it!

    <b>Breakfast Table: 7:30 May 18. 2014</b>
<br><br>
    Jen is taking out two mugs from the clapboard trimmed cabinet behind the kitchen island. She turns behind her to look at Markus seated at the breakfast 
    table and reading front section of the Wall Street Journal. <i>'We need to figure out what we're going to do for landscaping this year.'' </i><br><br> 

    Markus looks up and glances out the large window above the kitchen sink. <i>'I was thinking about getting the same people that Steven uses, he said he 
    likes them and anything would be better than the mess we had last year.'</i>
    <br><br>
    Jen begins scooping oatmeal into a bowl as she waits for the tea to steep. <i>'I just don't want to have to replant anything next year, that's all 
        I ask!'</i> she laughs, scraping her spoon against the bottom of the bowl as she stirs.
