        <b>Peterson Family Christmas Card, mailed December 1. 2009 </b>
        <br><br>
        Dear Family Near and Far,
        <br><br>
        It has been truly a stand-out year for the Peterson family. Jen and I have been blessed with so much love and support from all of you, 
        making this year full of bright moments, starting with our trip to the east coast 
        in June to celebrate Bradley's graduation from NYU. We were so lucky to be able to spend 5 days with the entire Fiddler family; John, Anne, Brian, 
        and Bradley of course. We were able to be there to watch Bradley walk across the stage and recieve his diploma, then get to visit some 
        beautiful places in NYC like the Statue of Liberty and Times Square, stopping at some amazing restauants along the way!

    <b>Breakfast Table: 7:30 January 3. 2009</b>
<br><br>
    Jen is taking out two mugs from the clapboard cabinet behind the kitchen island. She turns behind her to look at Markus seated at the breakfast 
    table and reading the front section of the Wall Street Journal. 
    "We need to figure out what we're going to do for landscaping this year."
<br><br>
    Markus looks up and glances out the large window above the kitchen sink. 
    "I was thinking about getting the same people that Steven uses, he said he 
    likes them and anything would be better than the mess we had last year."
    <br><br>
    Jen begins scooping oatmeal into a bowl as she waits for the tea to steep. 
    "I just don't want to have to replant anything next year, that's all 
        I ask!" She laughs, scraping her spoon against the bottom of the bowl as she stirs.

<br><Br>
    "Hey Markus, I just wanted to swing by this morning to check in on this question I had with the Hoyt Center Project." Markus looks up at the young man standing 
    in front of his desk. 
        <br><br>
    "Hm. Hi Henry, you have a question with the Hoyt documents?"
    <br><br>
    Henry stares hesitantly down and focuses on the skin wrinkled around Markus's eyes, round folds that look like rings of squeezed grey lotion. "I guess 
    it might be something I just need to take another look at, if you're busy this morning..."
    <br><br>
    "Yeah, those records are pretty complex, you'll probably need to take quite a bit of time with them." Markus leans back in his chair and meets the young 
    man's gaze.  
    <br><br>
    "Of course, I'm sure I can figure it out." Henry gives a few quick nods and slides quickly out of the office. Once the door closes, Markus calmly returns to 
    his open budget sheet.

    <b>Living Room: 10:45 January 3. 2009</b>
    <br><br>
Jen is putting away the dishes from the dish washer. Her radio in the kitchen is playing a <i>Train</i> song.
<br><br>
<i>God, I hate this dishwasher, it always leaves these, these spots, and I rinse everything first! Which I shouldn't have to do, I should really get Markus 
    to go to Home Depot and buy a new one, I don't know why he didn't do that for Christmas, I mean I guess I like the necklace too, it's a nice necklace, 
I'll wear it, but I don't really like yellow, and he should know that by now! It's been long enough, and he never just buys something blue. </i> 
<br><br>She notices 
an old hairline crack in one of the dinner plates. <br><br>
<i>Is Johanna a good student? That teacher, was it Carlson? she said she really enjoyed having Johanna but what does that mean? Is she good at anything? 
    What is she going to do? I would hate it if she didn't get into college, I know I'm supposed to love her no matter what, and I do, of course I do, but 
    I just don't know what that would mean, what would she do then? Oh well, we would figure it out, she's trustworthy, she's not going to make any huge 
    mistakes, and she's only eleven, everything is going to be just fine. 
</i>
<br><br>
Jen brushes a faint line of dust from the windowsill with her finger and is interupted by Lizzie jingling into the kitchen. 
<br><br>
"Walk time?"
