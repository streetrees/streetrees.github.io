I was looking in the mirror, it was quite important. I looked deep into the glass and examined the curve of my cheeks and my eye sockets. 
I looked at my nose from the front and the sides. I moved up on the edge of the sink to check my neck and the tops of my shoulders. 
I was by no means done when he knocked. Though he meant it innocently enough, tapping the wood with his full palm instead of his knuckles to create a quieter ask, 
I still hesitated. I looked at my new expression, watching my eyes move, and my mouth open slightly. His question came from behind the door, I smiled while I answered, 
and if he’d seen my face he’d have known I was laughing at him. But my voice was perfectly calm, and he said, <i>Alright</i> without knowing anything. When he’d gone, 
I went and sat on the toilet seat again, looking up at the starfish wall hanging. It looked real, although the net clinging to it was only decorative. 
On the sink were cream soaps that looked like shells, stacked in crumbling pile. There was a small blue window covered over with translucent film, 
so the outside world was made into vague shapes. I mostly ignored it. I mostly looked at the starfish. I let my eyes blur around the shape 
and its edges merged with the white wall. I could make it stand out even more this way, as though it were a real star burned black in my eye. 
<br><br>
I could hear him moving around in the kitchen and the hallway. Sometimes the glass and plates hit together and made a thin chime. He was thinking about me in here, 
trying to make noise enough to show that he believed everything was normal. He wanted me to see he wasn't waiting outside the door, that he had resumed his... 
there was a soft step in the hallway, he was passing by and trying to be quiet. 
<br><br>
I ignored him and went back to the mirror, when I looked at my face I could see the starfish hung behind me, my eyes circled around from the black star to my two 
large pupils. Three blue-glass bottles were arranged on a shelf, but they looked cheap in the incendecent lighting, my skin texture was different, I put a hand to 
my cheek and pulled the pores open and closed. 
<br><br>
We had watched a movie the night before, laying together on the rental couch and looking over at the small TV set propped on the side table. He'd laid down 
and waited for me to come next to him, which I had. The rental house had only one movie in the cabinet, <i>Titanic</i>, he'd taken it out and turned to me,
questioning. <i>Makes sense, why would they need a second movie?</i> I agreed, <i>Right, who could get past this one.</i>
<br><br>
We could hear the waves outside the window. From the rental we could look out over the trees and see one corner of the ocean, the 
light became purple. I looked at him preparing the TV in the corner of the room, wiping the dust from the screen with the palm of his hand. He turned back, 
<br><br>
<i>What do you think is left at the bottom of the ocean? From the Titanic I mean.</i>
<br><br>
<i>There's probably not much left at this point, the fish are eating it.</i>
<br><br>
<i>They can't have eaten all of it, it's all metal. Isn't there something on it they can't break down? What if someday only the diamonds are left?</i>
<br><br>
He looks back at the TV as it turns on, the light bathes us in a faraway glow. From outside, the window flickers.
