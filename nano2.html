working late (or each day? simply moving through the day, or does she take it seriously? spending every spare 
moment at the lab?)
she boots up the computer each morning (8:15) and she begins to observe the phytoplankton within the water sample 
(or does she? is this actually interesting? what is involved in observing the phytoplankton and 
zooplankton within a water sample? is there something else that is more interesting that she could be doing?)
she classifys zooplankton carefully, most are easy (are they? how varied is a usual water sample?) she can identify to 
species level (some not fixed at this point?) but others she has no idea and must fix and examine more closely with the 
microscope. 
She enjoys her job? (unsure, it will depend on what journey she is about to be on, what is she about to learn?)
The computer is old and clunky and she must observe the zooplankton under the micrscope and then write a 
short description of the sample and her hypothesized identification for the system. This is usually straightforward, 
there is even a drop-down bar for the species and many online and downloaded species resources for her to use. If she 
cannot match a species to a drop down she must examine the literature, has anyone noted species with these characteristics 
before? are they pleiotrophic characteristics? She has discovered a few new species with the help of her lab, this 
is before DNA barcoding (yes, that began in 2003)?  
this day begins like any other (don't they all) she boots up the computer and takes out a vial of water that she 
will be examining today (do labs have one person dedicated to observing zooplankton? probably not right, 
unless she's really good, does she have her dcotorate in microbiology? or is she an intern? I think an intern would 
be easier to write..)
Maybe she's a John type, exhausted with the entry level job after working there for 7 years or so, taking out 
water vial afte vial, observing plankton and microbes all day, not complaining but also so tired, taking out the 
vial to begin the morning is both comfortingly familiar and exhasutingly tedious. she's preoccupied with thinking 
about what she will do for lunch that day (what will she do?) or whatever other aspects of her day will uncover themselves 
as part of her personality. 
lets get to it: 
on this particular day, something will happen. as is the uncomfortable truth, some days things happen. 
some days things come together (like building a house, you spend each day working so hard for the one 
day a month when everything meets itself and suddenly something has happened (you have a working sink, etc)) 
some days bad things happen, these we do not work towards, or maybe in other ways we do, but some 
days you get the call that your cousin has died, or the challenger has exploded, or 5 people are trapped 
under the atlantic ocean, and something has suddenly changed that you could not have ever predicted when you woke up, 
or ate your breakfast, but now when you look back on the day it seems obvious, somewhere you knew already, 
that today was a day when something would happen. i.e. her hands grasped the vial so perfectly, the fit so correct 
that when she took the syringe and placed the drop on to the dish, she could almost see that something different was 
placed in front of her. she ignored this at the time of course, just moved the dish under the microscope and looked. 

was it immidiate? or did she examine a few plankton first, naming the normal species and then find the one 
of interest? and of course it is one, perhaps more later but a change should begin with one. capturing attention. 

but how can you see a smaller version of yourself? if it is a tiny fractal, why here? a tiny seated woman looking 
under a microscope wouldn't make much sense, unless it was too small to make out details, but still large enough for 
a regular microscope to view? seems more plausible that you would need a cutting edge microscope, i.e. we have just broken 
a barrier of human sight, etc. But you could have a mutation.. a fractal self could mutate to be large enough to be seen, or 
a part of a fractal self. But that's so literal, and requires the fractal self to be with her at all times, a single mini-me 
to each person. which seems untruthful. if she is witnessing a mutation it might be more cool to see her witness 
a cell using a smaller cell for energy, or something more bizarre since then I'll have to research how that actually works.. 
but she could observe a cell displaying an early or new form of life and then separate the cell and later that day the 
cell has asexually (or sexually?) reproduced, suddenly her plate has many such new life cells. 

that would be good, because then she could perhaps observe the cells becoming more advanced. 

the crux of the story is her inability to convey the discover to the rest of the lab? such as she is dealing with the 
knowledge that she is seeing a fractal of herself coming to life within the dish, but the others in the lab don't see the 
importance? or are they only downplaying it because they are also fractals that have been grown the same way, and perhaps 
they have already seen their smaller tendrils come to life.. but then why wouldn't that be an aspect of society? 

perhaps the growth happens very slowly? because if the fractal world grew quickly it would immidiately be examined 
by scientists more qualified than the intern. 
and why did it happen to be here? in her petri dish? why did it reveal itself to her? 
    - one could argue it had to be somewhere.. as the universe expands it must at some point become large enough to be 
    seen in a regular microscope.. and that would make sense that it would be in the ocean (but is our universe growing 
    at the same rate? then it would always be the same size in our universe, but perhaps there are many different 
    universes within each other, growing at different rates? but why would that be? )
    
    - treating the fractal world a bit more literally because having it be a true universe is kind of stupid and vague, it 
    could represent a story, or a mind. assuming it represents a story then the woman represents me, the author, 
    and the seed that she finds within the dish is the spark of the story that she will write. but then why is the seed a mirror 
    of herself? to say that stories are always just a reflection of our own lives? it's a metaphor for art.. okay.. 

    if the fractal world is her story that she wants to write (as it is literally for me) the fractal world will give her 
    fame, notority as an author, a book tour, peace that she has fullfilled her potential, peace that she is on the path that 
    she is supposed to be on, more ideas, the ability to express herself to others, to be understood. 

    so isn't it ironic (!) that the fractal world would be misunderstood by others, perhaps tearing her away from them? 
    isolating her? (reminiscent of addiction, ED, the percieved results (being loved and accepted because you are 
    funnier and more relaxed when you drink) become actually the cause of your isolation and your inabiilty to 
    recieve these things from others.) her proccupation with the fractal world is driven by her want for these things, she 
    begins to spend more and more time examining it, describing it, discovering more things within the story while her 
    life falls apart around her, she becomes isolated and can no longer relate to those around her, she is no longer living 
    her life, she is consumed with the imagined and perfect story, the reflection of herself that she wants others to see, the 
    ultimate creation/story and the normalicy of her life, simply speaking to others in the grocery store, seeing her partner 
    for a movie and dinner, these things no longer matter compared to the thrill of the creation (description?) of the fractal world. 

    so that's interesting, is she creating the world or describing it? really if it's a story metaphor than she would need 
    to actually be putting a lot of effort into making the world, perhaps the ending? that the fractal world that she is trying to 
    get others to see and understand is of her own making?
