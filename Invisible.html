I go to my father in the middle of the night and tell him, 
<br><br>
<i>I'm afraid I'm invisible</i>
<br><br>
he wakes, eyes green in the dark haze, 
<br><br>
<i>that's not true, I can see you quite clearly.</i>
<br><br>
But he's looking away from me, towards the wall. 
<br><br>
<i>Can't you admit you have no idea where I am? You can't even see what I'm wearing.</i>
<br><br>
He describes my clothes from when I was visible and continues pretending.
<br><br>
I realize I'm invisible everywhere, my friends lose track of me. 
At coffee shops they begin to serve the empty seat, having only a vague feeling someone is there. 
<br><br>
One day, on the street, a man approaches me. 
<br><br>
He looks right at me and starts yelling. 
<br><br>
I'd never heard someone admit it before, so I was startled and stayed put. 
<br><br>
I watch him at the crosswalk, he's yelling from his car. It almost seems like he's joking.  
<br><br>
It's then that he pulls out a gun, 
<br><br>
and I become really invisible,  
<br><br>
as I run away.
<br><br>
I called the police and told them someone had shot at me for being invisible. 
<br><br>
The officer laughed, <i>we already investigated that.</i>
<br><br>
<i>I found the shell casing on the ground, talked to witnesses, they all said that no one was there. 
</i>
<br><br>
<i>But why did the person shoot then?</i> I asked. <i>Why was there a shell casing?</i> 
<br><br>
<i>What about what I remember he said to me?</i>
<br><br>
The officer does not pause, <i>It seems like you're inserting yourself into this situation. Perhaps you only think he shot because you're invisible 
    because you have this need to be different. I believe you're actually quite visible, and so there would be no reason to shoot you. 
</i>
<br><br>
I was left with that same confusion. I went back to my father. 
<br><br>
<i>I have proof now.</i>
<br><br>
<i>You have to care about someone threatening my life. Can't you see I really am invisible? You're only imagining me now, I disappeared from your view a long 
    time ago. 
</i>
He laughs, he can't understand what I'm telling him. 
<br><br>
I realized even my memories didn't make sense. I'd been invisible so long that nobody visible could even understand what happened to me now. 
We lived on different sides of normal and surreal. 
<br><br>
When he'd shown me the gun, me and the shooter were the only people who could see what happened. 
<br><br>
Everyone else watched the bullet disappear into nothing.
