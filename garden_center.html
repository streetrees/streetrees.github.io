And what is the easy way out anyway? I'm looking at the socket wrenches, lined up all up and down the wall, half the labels have fallen off, and they've all been 
put in the wrong spots by how many young burly men running 'in the middle of a project', and now the 1/4 in. is hung on the 3/4 in. hook and where the fuck is the 
1/2 in.? 
<br><br>
'Ashley, hey, can you please run that plant back to garden? We really need to clear out the service desk.'
<br><br>
Can you please run that plant back to garden. You're talking about the houseplant sitting in the cart up at the service desk.
Yeah, I saw it. The one that's just four broken black stems sticking out of a water logged pot. Yeah sure let's put that back on the shelf. 
<br><br>
'Yeah, hey Kristy.' Kristy the service desk lead. Kristy who lives with her four cats in a trailer out in Westbend and still thinks she can tell me that I'm 
'actually not allowed to walk through the managers lounge to go out to smoke and actually I need to go all the way around to the front door.' Kristy who 
has seven yellow teeth but damn can she run a service center. I go on, 'I'll get to that, I'm helping out a customer right now.' 
<br><br>
'with hardware?' Her tattooed eyebrow arches and suddenly she's on me, and when's someone going to ask what she's doing right now? I see her fingers 
jingling and jangling with the American Spirit carton in her coat pocket. 'You know that's not really necessary. You should phone someone from hardware and 
head back to service, it'll take a lot less time since you know, you don't know where everything is in this department' she absolutely beams at the 
socket wrench wreckage in front of us, 'and someone from hardware could probably assist them more easily, does that make sense?'  
<br><br>
'Oh, completely.' I want to spend an entire day taking each wrench from it's hook one at a time, walking with my wrench down aisle 15, through the warehouse, 
through the managers lounge, and out to the parking lot, and then to her car, and then smashing each wrench through her window, one by one. 
<br><br>
She notices my tone and smiles, 'everything going good today?'  
<br><br>
Yeah. Everything is going good.
