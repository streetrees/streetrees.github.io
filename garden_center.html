I was at the service desk, she was in garden. A few times a day a customer would come up to my counter, sidling back and forth, 'is she ready for me?' and when I'd 
stare them down and say 'hello, ma'am' they'd say 'I'm looking for hoses' and at that point I would usually just tell them 'aisle 10' or maybe  
'did you know Home Depot has this app that tells you the exact location of every item in the store', and 'actually you don't need to speak to me at all, 
and please don't next time'. 
But if they needed a hose I would smile a bit, and I'd look them straight in the eye and say 
'follow me', and we'd walk together, them always a step behind, because walking beside me would be too personal, and we'd get to the hoses coiled floor 
to ceiling on aisle 10 and that's when I'd look through the clear corrogated plastic, searching the outdoor patio, until I saw her, maybe pointing at the 
fushia baskets or unloading sacks of fertilizer from the pallet, and the times she wasn't with a customer I'd wander out there, saying 'do you think this 
cactus might look nice at the service desk?'
