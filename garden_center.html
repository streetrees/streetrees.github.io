And what is the easy way out anyway? I'm looking at the socket wrenches, lined up all up and down the wall, half the labels have fallen off, and they've all been 
put in the wrong spots by how many young burly men running 'in the middle of a project', and now the 1/4 in. is hung on the 3/4 in. hook and where the fuck is the 
1/2 in.? 
<br><br>
'Ashley, hey, can you please run that plant back to garden? We really need to clear out the service desk.'
<br><br>
Can you please run that plant back to garden. You're talking about the houseplant sitting in the cart up at the service desk.
Yeah, I saw it. The one that's just four broken black stems sticking out of a water logged pot. Yeah sure let's put that back on the shelf. 
<br><br>
'Yeah, hey Kristy.' Kristy the service desk lead. Kristy who lives with her four cats in a trailer out in Westbend and still thinks she can tell me that I'm 
'actually not allowed to walk through the managers lounge to go out to smoke and actually I need to go all the way around to the front door.' Kristy who 
has seven yellow teeth but damn can she run a service center. I go on, 'I'll get to that, I'm helping out a customer right now.' 
<br><br>
'with hardware?' Her tattooed eyebrow arches and suddenly she's on me, and when's someone going to ask what she's doing right now? I see her fingers 
jingling and jangling with the American Spirit carton in her coat pocket. 'You know that's not really necessary. You should phone someone from hardware and 
head back to service, it'll take a lot less time since you know, you don't know where everything is in this department' she absolutely beams at the 
socket wrench wreckage in front of us, 'and someone from hardware could probably assist them more easily, does that make sense?'  
<br><br>
'Oh, completely.' I want to spend an entire day taking each wrench from it's hook one at a time, walking with my wrench down aisle 15, through the warehouse, 
through the managers lounge, and out to the parking lot, and then to her car, and then smashing each wrench through her window, one by one. 
<br><br>
She notices my tone and smiles, 'Everything going good today?'  
<br><br>
Yeah. Everything's great today! It's 2 pm and I have another 7 hours to be here, and after that, what? At 9 I'll clock out and get into my shitty Toyota 
and drive back home where mom will be.. god yeah and it's Friday so she'll probably be incapacitated.. where mom will be sitting up on the couch ready to 
talk to me about 'how things are going' and I'm not looking forward to having that conversation then so no, Kristy, I won't be having that conversation with you now.
<br><br> 
'Oh, yeah! I'm just a little tired today.' I gauge her concern, 'It's been a week.' 
<br><br>
'Oh trust me I get it.' Her eyes widen and I can see the veins gripping them in bloody sockets, I believe her. 'Still, try not to bring that sort 
of energy into your day here, you'll be much happier if you can learn to let go.' She bobs her head like she's shaking something out of her 
skull. 
<br><br>
It's been a week. 
<br><br>
Wednesday, mom locked herself out of the house. Suddenly it was all 'Ashley, I need you to come and help me.' no more, 'you need to be more independent' when 
she's the one standing out on the porch, just in a bathrobe, and where was she going at 9 am anyway? That we never got to. But I did it, I didn't even need 
to bother my manager, just told my buddy there was a big shipment in recieving I was going to help out with, and Jeff's always good for those things. Not that 
the lock out was what put me over the edge, it was the aftermath. She couldn't just leave it, go back to watching whatever cop show rerun and say, 'hey, 
thanks for the help' no, I'm standing in the living room saying 'mom, I have to go back to work' while she has to tell me every milisecond of how she thought 
for sure the key was in her robe pocket, and then suddenly she was outside, and how could it have gone missing in her walk out the door? 
<br><br>
Kristy is still giving me a look, doesn't she have kids or something to check up on? 'Yeah, I'm sure things are on the way up!' She doesn't know it but I 
mean ascension. I forget about the guy who needed the wrench and head back to service. 
<br><br>
There was one good thing about having to take that plant to garden. We just got a new girl working there, I think her name's Juliana or something stupid like that. 
I saw her yesterday when I was showing some guy where the wasp traps are, 'and could a honey bee possibly get stuck in one of these?' I called her over, 
our garden expert is right here to assist you! She's much more knowledgable about the functionality of each product we carry. I know she's just going to read the 
back, as I walked away I saw her turn it over, but there was a look, when I first caught her eye. She was already watching us as she lifted a 40 lb bag of 
potting soil onto her shoulder, swinging it up in a fluid motion, I thought it was her first day? But I knew what was happening. Her entrance to our
