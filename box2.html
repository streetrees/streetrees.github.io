    I saw something I never told you
    the night I drove to get you. 

    You were waiting for me, curled up on the couch, lying next to your mom. She asked you where I was, at that point I 
    had just crossed out of Idaho, 400 miles to Bozeman. You weren't worried, I'd called you before I left, you knew I'd really come. 
    
    I can't remember most of that drive. 
    I was so different then, pushing myself where I should not have been
    pressing myself into you. 
    I never thought about why I was going.  
    Just started driving one morning because I said I would.    
 
    Nobody but you and your mom knew where I was that day. 
    I felt like a ghost, slipping unnoticed down the highway. 
    Of course
    I thought about you, about how 
    we might fix this, about if I really loved you. 

    I just stopped once, to get gas late at night. 
    A few minutes down a back road and I found a gas station. Among the fields, set back from the road, ring of 
    dark trees, light seeping into the dark country.   
    There were just two pumps 
    lit by a single orange bulb between them. 
    It seemed like a dream I'd had.  
    My car caught in the sprawling body of Montana night. Something I'd wanted was here, a thought realized. 

    There was no sound, no wind, just the low growl of the highway in the distance. The pump took my card and spit it back out, I fumbled with the 
    nozzle and stood against the pump, frigid, I found our constellation. 

    'ARE YOU SURE' 

    scratched in the gas pump screen. 

    the words continued, moving out of the screen and on to the metal, bending down and out of sight. 

    'YOU ARE REALLY HERE'

    I touched the scratches and felt the frozen sharp edge

    That's when I heard breathing, animal, and high pitched scraping on the asphalt.  
    I turned and saw
    his eyes reflecting the light of the gas pump in two faint orbs, his head down, his 
    body in shadow. 
    
    the elk shrouded in blood and strange ornaments, tendrils hanging where they should not be. 
    Antlers had formed to the first tine but 
    then formed down, falling back and to the ground, the tines reaching out in strange branches. 
    The beam curled like a snail shell, turned back at the ends and splitting 
    to form the crown, three tines on one side and two on the other. They had grown inwards. The five tips piercing through the skin, dissappearing into bloody 
    sockets that cut into his cheek, his neck.  

    He was softly turning his head and rubbing the bottom of the 
    antler into the asphalt, limply starting as the skin moved around the tines, they did not dislodge. His breathing labored. 

    He scraped at the ground with his hooves and murmured, the antlers hung fluid. 

    His eyes turned to the ground, his head down, only the wistful scraping, and the cars moving far away. 

    He did not see me, and I did not move to help him. The tines gripped his head and neck like hands. 

    The pump had stopped, I slowly placed it back in the cradle, watching him. I opened the car door quietly and moved inside.
    I couldn't see him as I drove away, just orange light floating over us both.  

    When I got to your house that night you were already asleep. Wrapped in a blanket, all quiet, your book on the table. 
    You took me inside, we moved my things to your room and I told you it had been such a long drive. I wondered 
    if you could tell what I left out. But you just listened while I talked about seeing snow in the mountains. 

    When we woke the next morning your mom made us tea. 
    I held your hand when we drove into town that afternoon, you kissed me lightly in the car. We saw the snow laid over the fields and the sunlight coating it 
    in orange slivers and gold. We moved softly through creaking wood and the smell of smoke, people in down coats smiling. I never tried to tell 
    you about it, just took your hand and told you I loved you. 

    It was already four in the afternoon when we left for Portland, too late to start that drive, too late for winter. 

    This part I know you remember. 
    As we drove into the pass and the snow began to pick up, the night fell, 
    snow began to cover the windshield, the road, soon our tires started to slip
    the back of the car spun over and over. I was gripping the wheel with white hands
    you screamed as the car slid in and out, we looked out the windshield and it was 
    only white, I didn't know where the road ended and the snow began, it was all fog. 

    You said we should stop. But we couldn't. The snow lit with the lights of cars ahead and behind, we could only follow the long trail, sliding and correcting, 
    my hands stuck to the wheel.

    That night we gave back what we owed. Driving into the bright lights of Coeur d'Alene, pulling up to the motel, we were quiet as we entered the little green room. 
    I lay down on the bed under the framed sky and watched you silently remove your clothes. 

    The next morning I made us coffee in the hotel room. Then we left early, the sky blue-grey, snow melted in soft piles. 

    It was an hour before we spoke,  

    It's not going to work. I said. 

    I'm afraid you can't protect me.
