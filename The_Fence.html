I fell in love with her on the side of the road. She was very delicate with posts that seemed almost useless with the gap left, a mouse could easily slip through 
her small arches, or even song birds, I watched them fly between the pastures she separated. 
<br><br>
For the first week I only watched her turning gold beneath the morning sun, her gaps revealed to be 
filled with spider webs, a lace which drew the eye even more to the thin posts, her sharp angles at the top, machined, yet, as I finally 
approached her, rough I saw, places where the wood was left unsanded. I wished to run my hand from the top of the arch to the bottom, but I stood a few steps 
away and only watched her. I wasn't sure yet if she liked me. 
<br><br>
I came at noon and leaned against her as I ate my lunch, people driving by would have thought I was only taking a rest. I started to speak with her quietly, asking 
what she thought of me. She said I was beautiful, and she liked feeling my back against her, I smiled and leaned farther, my back moving into the gaps between the 
posts, my skin beginning to form to her shape. I loved that she was so useless as a fence, I told her, <i>anything at all can get past you!</i>
<i>I can see the entire field behind you,</i> she blushed and became embarrassed, 
<br><br>
<i>Can you see what I'm thinking?</i> she asked, 
<br><br>
<i>Yes, it's easy to read you, you are always predictable,</i>
<br><br>
She rocked slightly in the afternoon wind and went quiet. 
<br><br>
In the morning, I came with a shovel, I disconnected a small section from the rest and carefully dug around the posts, I didn't speak with her, and covered my 
face with a scarf so she wouldn't recognize me. 
<br><br>
At home I placed her upright near my bed and left her alone to settle. I took a sheet and placed it over her, obscuring the spaces so I could no longer 
look through her, when I lay on my bed I looked into the white figure and could not see the other side of the room, I imagined someone coming in without me 
knowing. 
<br><br>
That evening she started to talk again, she was very excited to be with me, <i>I always hated being alone at night,</i> she said. At home I would often imagine her 
back in the pasture, as I moved my hand over the rough wood, I imaged her standing taunt against the wind. When I drove past the field however, I still looked, 
and saw the empty space where she once was.
