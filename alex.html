<br><br><h2><i>Does the mayfly in June?</i><br></h2><br>
It takes two diagonal pieces<br>
<br>
Put them on the floor<br>
<br>
And descend into the floor boards<br>
<br>
Under each house <br>
<br>
Claims another <br>
<br>
It was a house on a hill<br>
<br>
Lit by moonlight <br>
<br>
It was sent among wolves <br>
<br>
As they chatted to the maintenance<br>
<br><br>
They spoke of <br>
<br>
And this <br>
<br>
With us<br>
<br>
In a moment <br>
<br>
I fear I may fall<br>
<br>
She told <br>
<br>
It’s a sensation of sowing time<br>
<br>
For a slow sensation <br>
<br>
His eyes were wonder <br>
<br>
Calm circles <br>
<br>
Rugged leather drapes on a window <br>
<br>
For understanding <br>
<br><br>
He sailed the seas <br>
<br>
Under worded <br>
<br>
And <br>
<br>
With a <br>
<br>
I saw<br>
<br>
And if felt<br>
<br><br>
They told me they never felt understood <br>
<br>
Quite like this<br>
<br><br>
Maintenance were<br>
<br>
They listened and said<br>
<br><br>
You have a tendency <br>
<br>
Remember to <br>
<br>
And claim the tide<br>
<br><br>
When your feet disappeared in the sand<br>
<br>
The grains would suck at the bottom<br>
<br>
I feared I would lose them<br>
<br>
As I stared at lines in water <br>
<br>
Held there together <br>
<br>
Waiting for <br>
<br><br><br>
I never knew his <br>
<br>
Until the same <br>
<br>
His essence was his<br>
<br>
The air would radiate <br>
<br>
Send a signal to the sky to move from sun to night<br>
<br>
Various dogs jumped across a wooden sofa for us<br>
<br>
As light beams reign from the torch of change searching for <br>
<br>
I wonder if I’ll go away <br>
<br>
By wind<br>
<br><br>
We sat here<br>
<br>
When it was an unknown time <br>
<br>
Claimed in empty space <br>
<br>
Awaiting to settle <br>
<br>
In realms<br>
<br>
They flow with the night <br>
<br>
A heart gains a rhythm that felt unfamiliar in familiarity <br>
<br>
It was a different pattern <br>
<br>
He was often working with <br>
<br>
But <br>
<br>
Alas<br>
<br>
The time was neigh<br>
<br>
As <br>
<br>
And things felt like a normal dream<br>
<br>
That claimed a huge space <br>
<br><br>
I wonder if<br>
<br>
The maintenance <br>
<br>
Not working tonight <br>
<br><br>
We are mere wolves<br>
<br>
We roamed the seas on our fur<br>
<br>
It’s why we <br>
<br>
And that’s all we know<br>
<br><br>
I am fearful and excited <br>
<br>
She thought <br>
<br>
Is this me<br>
<br>
Or another <br>
<br><br>
She preferred to resemble a different reality <br>
<br>
Instead of choosing the <br>
<br>
She’d remember<br>
<br>
That <br>
<br>
He’s nice to feel for<br>
<br>
In open space <br>
<br>
Letting the air in and out <br>
<br>
To remain breezy <br>
<br>
And not stifled <br>
<br>
With her madness<br><br><br><br><br><br>{image 11}
<br><br>
<br>
<h1><i>Image in scene</i></h1>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Senses of he<br>
<br>
Echo in my palms <br>
<br>
Vibration of tender barch<br>
<br>
Ready to sleep<br>
<br>
It’s time <br>
<br>
I felt as though we floated <br>
<br>
In positions of dreams <br>
<br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
There is a sense of calming<br>
<br>
When the scented breeze subsides <br>
<br>
We feel the denial of scent<br>
<br>
It’s nice to claim a plain of pleasure <br>
<br>
An open field<br>
<br>
Sending a warning to the other fields<br>
<ul><li>it’s time to make a new field</li></ul><br>
When fields work in their own field but try<br>
<br>
To open up new fields<br>
<br>
To see with eyes that see<br>
<br><br>
She’s calm<br>
<br>
He mirrored<br>
<br>
I felt a sense<br>
<br>
And that’s all I needed to<br>
<br>
With sensation her house felt like a place to stay when it was windy outside<br>
<br>
I found the house perfect for a size of the duvet measure<br>
<br>
In my own mind<br>
<br>
The scenes of passage<br>
<br>
Under the tremor<br>
<br>
Vibrations and frequencies<br>
<br>
Seattle lay sleepless<br>
<br>
Cried out for a Hollywood ending<br>
<br>
As if endings existed<br>
<br><br><br>
If ends begin<br>
<br>
Once the end finishes<br>
<br>
Where does the foot stepped<br>
<br>
Walter is still waiting for his dinner<br>
<br>
And he’s always going to be there<br>
<br>
Isn’t it.<br>
<br><br>
I never understood<br>
<br>
Why is<br>
<br>
And what can<br>
<br>
Involving<br>
<br>
When the beats of hearts are there to measure a science of<br>
<br>
I lost a<br>
<br>
Under it all<br>
<br><br>
Sometimes I don’t know where I stand<br>
<br>
When I’m sitting<br>
<br>
She knelt down<br>
<br>
Sowed something<br>
<br><br>
You seem calmer<br>
<br>
He mirrored<br>
<br>
Using the reflection of the photo frame<br>
<br>
I spotted things<br>
<br>
They felt worth spotting<br>
<br>
I feel as though<br>
<br>
There’s a whole<br>
<br>
In the middle of the earth<br>
<br>
And it’s called<br>
<br>
Middle earth<br>
<br><br>
Ha ha ha<br>
<br>
He laughed and laughed<br>
<br>
She was<br>
<br>
And that was it<br>
<br><br><br><br>
It’s calm here<br>
<br>
After a long time<br>
<br>
It’s calm<br>
<br>
The blood in her chest moved back and forward<br>
<br>
She could feel her heart beat<br>
<br>
It was there<br>
<br>
Emerging between the sensations<br>
<br><br><br><br>
Sprinkled leaves<br>
<br>
Oversa hole<br>
<br>
Plummeted<br>
<br>
I fell into<br>
<br>
And landed in a place I didn’t understand<br>
<br>
In time<br>
<br>
Isn’t it ready?<br>
<br>
I don’t know<br>
<br>
She said<br>
<br>
I’ve worked so<br>
<br>
And saw morning<br>
<br>
It rises with the<br>
<br>
Disappointing<br>
<br>
How it always<br>
<br>
Never<br>
<br>
In a place<br>
<br>
I forget<br>
<br><br>
I feel as though the fabric of existence has changed<br>
<br>
I am beyond biographical<br>
<br>
I am my own book<br>
<br>
Pages<br>
<br><br>
Flopping in the wind<br>
<br>
I don’t know how it would have felt<br>
<br>
Seeing a number one best seller<br>
<br>
Claiming the number two spot<br>
<br>
Water is emerging for us<br>
<br>
He<br>
<br>
Which is fine<br>
<br><br>
Nothing was<br>
<br>
Because it had all changed<br>
<br><br>
She didn’t know how it would<br>
<br>
I’ve personalized this all<br>
<br>
It’s okay<br>
<br>
Okay<br>
<br><br>
Okay<br>
<br>
Ok<br>
<br>
Okay<br>
<br>
Okay<br>
<br><br>
Okay<br>

<br><i>After</i> <br>
<br><br>
Across the side is a wolf<br>
<br>
In side tabled fashion he<br>
<br>
Embarked<br>
<br>
There’s a side of a road<br>
<br>
And something carries him along<br>
<br>
As passing<br>
<br>
In movement <br>
<br>
The light hits the open edge <br>
<br>
Of prosperity within activity<br>
<br><br>
she sat there busy <br>
<br>
She was runner <br>
<br>
From one to another <br>
<br>
Her goblonic nature surpasses <br>
<br>
Between one <br>
<br>
And another <br>
<br>
The sun was strong on her cheeks <br>
<br>
In a series of actions she was screaming <br>
<br>
With her mouth open <br>
<br>
With the power of gloop between her thighs <br>
<br>
She claimed her moment <br>
<br>
A light of spotted upon her gaze<br>
<br><br>
A bright light cannot see<br>
<br>
And prevents <br>
<br>
For better visions<br>
<br>
Between us is a space of missing<br>
<br><br>
Is it too <br>
<br>
To miss<br>
<br>
When the moment felt<br>
<br>
Is that<br>
<br>
And wondering<br>
<br>
With backpack flower<br>
<br>
A protection upon his majestic journey <br>
<br>
From one place<br>
<br>
To another<br>
<br><br>
The wind would have touched his face<br>
<br>
And made his hair move <br>
<br>
He’s eyes would see<br>
<br>
His mind would think<br>
<br>
And he would talk about <br>
<br>
As human sensation <br>
<br>
Regularly is<br>
<br><br>
He,<br>
<br>
However<br>
<br>
And might among the most <br>
<br>
And settle <br>
<br>
In calm<br>
<br><br>
I fear for clarity <br>
<br>
As I’m<br>
<br>
It’s hard for me to describe<br>
<br>
With words<br>
<br>
When I have the mind <br>
<br>
Without <br>
<br>
Subliminal language <br>
<br>
Some call it<br>
<br>
But others<br>
<br>
Say<br>
<br>
It’s to do with how bodies interact<br>
<br>
They call it<br>
<br>
Ah<br>
<br>
“Body language”<br>
<br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
I always wondered <br>
<br>
What it all<br>
<br>
If present <br>
<br>
Is placed<br>
<br>
We are <br>
<br>
Anything<br>
<br><br>
It isn’t so<br>
<br>
To think<br>
<br><br>
In over<br>
<br>
Think<br>
<br>
The placement of <br>
<br>
Makes sense<br>
<br>
If you see which<br>
<br>
When others <br>
<br>
Say <br>
<br>
Stay cool in the sun <br>
<br>
It’s important to regulate temperature <br>
<br>
Something she always got wrong <br>
<br>
In a jacket<br>
<br>
Let’s guess <br>
<br>
6 x X L<br>
<br>
Covered in her own stimulation<br>
<br>
For asexual being<br>
<br><br>
Her hat was decorated with a clown<br>
<br>
For which lapped with her ears <br>
<br>
Which would cause inflammation of annoyance <br>
<br>
But yet<br>
<br>
Claims her calm<br>
<br><br>
And he returned from <br>
<br>
With<br>
<br>
To<br>
<br>
Say<br>
<br>
And what<br>
<br>
We saw <br>
<br>
In our world <br>
<br>
That went in various directions <br>
<br>
Over the last few days <br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
The planetarium is a place that replicates the sensation of being in space<br>
<br>
In time<br>
<br>
It will feel as recreate <br>
<br>
Because it is infact, <br>
<br>
Not the real environment <br>
<br><br>
Planet<br>
<br>
Arium must translate to imitation for educational means<br>
<br><ul><li>thinking about space</li></ul><br>
Is exhausting<br>
<br>
When your down below<br>
<br><br>
It’s all too direct<br>
<br>
I fear I am becoming clear<br>
<br>
For fear of resolve<br>
<br>
Is fear of place<br>
<br><br><br><br>
IIII<br>
<br><br>
It all makes sense<br>
<br>
She tells herself<br>
<br>
Because it does<br>
<br>
And the hurt she feels<br>
<br>
Is past<br>
<br><br>
And present is a gift<br>
<br>
He gave her<br>
<br>
And she gave him<br>
<br><br>
It’s time to rest<br>
<br>
After all<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
{image 4}<br><br>
<br><br><br><h2><i>It’s really hard to do this on my own<br>
<br>
But I don’t feel quite so alone</i></h2><i></i><br><br><br><br>
Even through abstract formation<br>
<br>
Emotions run beyond the seas edge<br>
<br>
Revealing some thing, but cannot be seen<br>
<br>
But merely felt<br>
<br><br>
I never<br>
<br>
I can’t<br>
<br>
I have pain between my arms<br>
<br>
They fear me like her<br>
<br>
For becoming like<br>
<br>
Would mean the end<br>
<br><br>
I am not here<br>
<br>
I am something else<br>
<br>
I cannot<br>
<br>
Forbode existence<br>
<br>
Estimations pending<br>
<br>
Evaluation’s written<br>
<br>
Yet nothing revealed<br>
<br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
I feel as though I understand<br>
<br>
I’m what you say does not produce fear<br>
<br>
And what I think, feel or consider<br>
<br>
Is slow like the tide in and out<br>
<br>
As Moonlight shines<br>
<br>
Into your mouth<br>
<br>
Into my ears<br>
<br>
Into my autonomy<br>
<br>
Into whatever is coming<br>
<br>
I am not scared<br>
<br>
For I have already departed<br>
<br>
In the eyes of my father<br>
<br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
Father away<br>
<br>
I’ll await a call<br>
<br>
Because we cannot<br>
<br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
I walk slowly<br>
<br>
As if I am already old<br>
<br>
I’ve spent moments<br>
<br>
Seeking age<br>
<br>
Upon my face<br>
<br><br>
She is tired and I can see<br>
<br>
Yet young she still<br>
<br>
Isn’t it fantastic?<br>
<br>
I’m sorry I hate direct questions<br>
<br>
I don’t know if it’s fantastic<br>
<br>
All I know is, it’s the face I have<br>
<br><br><br><br>
IIIIII<br>
<br><br>
I’ll sit next to you<br>
<br>
Because it’s where I like to be<br>
<br>
Disappear and I will let<br>
<br>
What you already feel is right<br>
<br>
Understanding is a gift<br>
<br>
I’ll still see you<br>
<br>
Listening to us<br>
<br>
Talking like humans probably should<br>
<br>
In ways, I am now learning<br>
<br>
What real conversation can be<br>
<br><br>
Two. Wide circles.<br>
<br>
Stare at me<br>
<br>
We controlled the time<br>
<br>
For all of the time<br>
<br>
Available<br>
<br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
Sadness is grief<br>
<br>
And joy in progress<br>
<br>
Grant relief<br>
<br>
Lay upon your own body<br>
<br>
For protection<br>
<br><br>
You have the gift<br>
<br>
It lies within you<br>
<br>
Is shining<br>
<br>
That’s how I know<br>
<br>
I saw it when we first talked<br>
<br><br>
And since<br>
<br>
I’m here<br>
<br><br>
I’m here<br>

A dark blue swirl<br>
<br>
Wind formed around <br>
<br>
In, among<br>
<br>
Speaking <br>
<br>
Among worded language <br>
<br>
With comments <br>
<br>
That held meaning <br>
<br><br>
An edge <br>
<br>
Filled the sky<br>
<br>
Among the many molecules <br>

Cule to see<br>

In different time<br>

She found <br>
<br>
And see <br>
<br>
That it’s <br>
<br>
And intention <br>

With a clear round edge<br>
<br>
Realizing no one will <br>
<br>
From her self<br>

People are in lives <br>
<br>
For living<br>
<br><br>
They make a living<br>
<br>
They see life they made<br>

It’s usual<br>
<br>
To continue <br>
<br>
When things come up<br>
<br><br>
I feel blocked <br>

She claimed <br>
<br>
I fear I am blocked in my own<br>
<br>
There is only me standing <br>
<br>
In ways<br>
<br><br>
But the tide<br>
<br>
Is passing through<br>
<br>
And sea metaphors<br>
<br>
Are made of liquid<br>
<br>
With referential <br>
<br><br>
I want to be around you<br>
<br>
Because life is better with you in it<br>
<br>
There’s a feeling that <br>
<br>
Evermore this<br>
<br>
And overwhelm <br>
<br>
In tears <br>
<br>
Melt my inside <br>
<br>
As I know how I think <br>
<br>
Because of how I’m made <br>
<br><br>
The night is growing blue <br>
<br>
The sky is forming as an edge of hat<br>
<br>
I don’t know <br>
<br>
Because I never knew how it was <br>
<br>
Or what was meant <br>

With clear skies forming <br>
<br>
Casting shadows above <br>
<br>
Below<br>
<br>
Side to sides<br>
<br>
Swinging across<br>
<br><br>
I screamed <br>
<br>
When I saw my dads glasses would fall <br>
<br>
From his face <br>
<br>
On the banana boat<br>
<br>
It’s like a pirate ship<br>
<br>
But it’s a banana <br>
<br><br>
Like told sources of potassium <br>
<br>
She lay in silence<br>
<br>
Hearing the sounds of her ears<br>
<br>
Peddling past<br>
<br>
Ringing of clasps<br>
<br>
The sound <br>
<br>
Of her own<br>

Inner voice <br>

Upended <br>

As she lay <br>

I’ll will you to all the <br>

You deserve<br>

Because people like you<br>

Deserve everything <br>

Slay king<br>

Into the night <br>

And slay <br>

But stay<br>

It’s nice to be here<br>

To know<br>

You’re not the only one<br>

Over and over<br>

As she listened to herself<br>
<br>
How harsh<br>

Can be <br>

With time<br>

She knew<br>

As each step she felt<br>

Confirmation bias<br>
<br><br>
Inside<br>
<br>
Lived her<br>
<br>
The night hours<br>
<br>
As moon<br>
<br>
Comes shine<br>
<br>
And says <br>
<br>
For the day<br>
<br><br>
The period of time<br>
<br>
That’s slept <br>
<br>
She ponders<br>
<br>
What comes<br>
<br>
When resting<br>
<br><br>
An ache in her heart<br>
<br>
Is always present<br>
<br>
A wound she holds<br>
<br>
To prevent bleeding<br>
<br>
As she holds one<br>
<br>
She creates another <br>
<br>
And mirrors a sense<br>
<br>
That everything she knew<br>
<br>
Was <br>
<br>
And what’s to come<br>
<br>
Is<br>
<br>
But what more<br>
<br>
When she already felt<br>
<br>
Her mind break<br>
<br>
Into disassociation realms<br>
<br>
Hiding from what’s in front<br>
<br>
Leaving a layer she cannot <br>
<br>
And will not <br>
<br>
Touch<br>
<br><br>
Her head was in a corner way<br>
<br>
It said<br>
<br>
Keep going<br>
<br>
There’s more to find out<br>
<br>
But each she find<br>
<br>
Was creating more wounds<br>
<br>
Until she remains a body standing <br>
<br>
Barely<br>
<br>
With seeing<br>
<br>
All over her face<br>
<br>
Hidden memories that<br>
<br>
Clamber over her <br>
<br>
Like someone trying to gain <br>
<br>
The entire back catalogue <br>
<br><br>
It isn’t enough<br>
<br>
She is<br>
<br>
Because despite all changes<br>
<br>
She will always remain <br>
<br>
Within the midnight of sadness<br>
<br>
Hours as the shadows pass her brow<br>
<br>
She has two of them <br>
<br>
I humor <br>
<br>
She passed the sentiment she was<br>
<br>
But ignoring<br>
<br>
What present<br>
<br>
Within her body <br>
<br>
Held trauma <br>
<br><br>
A protective shell <br>
<br>
Curves her back forward <br>
<br>
Making her desirable to the pebbles in sand<br>
<br>
But not to others<br>
<br>
Despite her best efforts <br>
<br>
Her smile always held<br>
<br>
A deep sadness <br>
<br>
From absorbed <br>
<br>
Prolonged <br>
<br>
Layers of melancholy <br>
<br>
Forbode her mind<br>
<br>
Into unconscious disappearance<br>
<br><br>
I want to hide<br>
<br>
And show nothing<br>
<br>
But I fear I will be <br>
<br>
If I do<br>
<br>
My shine will fade<br>
<br>
As the lights come onto<br>
<br>
Reveres brows<br>
<br>
Bushy like a park bench<br>
<br>
Waiting for older <br>
<br><br>
She wondered <br>
<br>
What she might be <br>
<br>
When she is no longer in her own<br>
<br>
Worked out condition <br>
<br>
Of demand<br>
<br>
Upon herself<br>
<br><br>
Behind every thought <br>
<br>
Lies a sense of intensity<br>
<br>
And it’s felt<br>
<br>
She knows <br>
<br>
She attempts to hide it<br>
<br>
But <br>
<br>
It’s there<br>
<br><br>
And what of it<br>
<br>
Place a joke here<br>
<br>
To prevent feeling the sadness<br>
<br>
Everything she ever felt <br>
<br>
Was taken away from her<br>
<br>
Because she was not able to live<br>
<br>
In ways that humans should<br>
<br><br>
Because she is mentally ill<br>
<br>
And it’s starting to show <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>{image 9}<br><br><br>
<small>I wore a suit</small><br>
<br>
<small><i>With you in mind</i></small><br>
<br><br>
It was prepared for<br>
<br>
Performance <br>
<br>
Yet,,,<br>
<br>
Thoughts sprang<br>
<br>
As I saw <br>
<br><br>
I thought<br>
<br>
I know he’ll like this<br>
<br>
And so do I<br>
<br><br>
The collar of the neck <br>
<br>
Shirt,,,<br>
<br>
In among <br>
<br>
Felt different <br>
<br>
To days of <br>
<br>
Being in another<br>
<br>
It felt as though<br>
<br>
I was a <br>
<br>
In the form of masc<br>
<br>
Eroding the sensation<br>
<br>
You have to run<br>
<br>
Or hide<br>
<br>
From<br>
<br>
What <br>
<br>
And where<br>
<br>
It all came from<br>
<br><br>
There is<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
When you embrace the other <br>
<br>
For which you came <br>
<br>
I felt it would change<br>
<br>
But it reinforced<br>
<br><br>
You arrived<br>
<br>
He saw<br>
<br>
And I knew <br>
<br>
What he saw<br>
<br>
Was what I did<br>
<br><br>
Was once<br>
<br>
When I would say<br>
<br>
I am not coming <br>
<br>
Because I am not this<br>
<br>
I am that <br>
<br>
Back when things changed<br>
<br>
Permanently <br>
<br><br>
A sinister sensation rose<br>
<br>
When the older wounds<br>
<br>
If her dads years passing through<br>
<br>
As father became father away <br>
<br>
Father away<br>
<br>
Father away <br>
<br>
Into obscurity <br>
<br><br>
When she<br>
<br>
Claimed what she feared <br>
<br>
It felt like full circle <br>
<br>
Came<br>
<br>
Back forth <br>
<br><br>
It wasn’t for fear<br>
<br>
Or fear or<br>
<br>
Fear it would come<br>
<br>
Back<br>
<br><br>
There,,,<br>
<br>
Is no way back<br>
<br><br>
I made a permanent shift that cannot<br>
<br>
Un do<br>
<br>
And angst that lives in corners<br>
<br>
,, if her past <br>
<br>
We’re to exist <br>
<br>
At all<br>
<br><br>
There isn’t <br>
<br>
Another way <br>
<br><br>
The only walk path<br>
<br>
Walks one way to here<br>
<br>
Here<br>
<br>
Is a place you made<br>
<br>
From opposite components <br>
<br>
To ensure <br>
<br>
You claim what you were born with<br>
<br><br>
Yourself <br>
<br><br><br>
He saw<br>
<br>
And she saw<br>
<br>
On the sea tide <br>
<br>
As water washed over them<br>
<br>
As they ran from the <br>
<br>
That wouldn’t be <br>
<br>
Because <br>
<br>
It’s what they deserve <br>
<br><br>
To be<br>
<br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
Since my father’s wedding<br>
<br>
When everything changed <br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>{image 7}<br><br><br>
<br><small><i>They lay there</i></small> <br>

The rectangle was designed with <br>
<br>
And us in mind <br>
<br><br>
He stole my sheet<br>
<br>
And a leg would dangle out of coverage <br>
<br>
Steal it back<br>
<br>
He said <br>
<br><br>
And so she <br>
<br>
As she medium <br>
<br>
Placed it over her leg<br>
<br>
Because he looked cute<br>
<br>
With more of the duvet <br>
<br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
When the sun is out <br>
<br>
It’s easier to <br>
<br>
Because clouds form <br>
<br>
Like generic path ways<br>
<br>
Led from a vaccum <br>
<br>
Sucking the air <br>
<br>
I’m among <br>
<br>
The water leaves<br>
<br>
Make me wet<br>
<br>
With rain water<br>
<br><br>
Small moments of water<br>
<br>
Roll down my cheek<br>
<br>
It was a bad week for her<br>
<br>
She could feel the <br>
<br>
Uphill vile<br>
<br>
In comparitive to what she<br>
<br>
When she had to stop<br>
<br>
Relief would reign <br>
<br>
And her bones would settle <br>
<br>
As the inventory would file<br>
<br>
A range of new activity<br>
<br><br>
A possession was in effect<br>
<br>
She shouted stop it to the air <br>
<br>
Nothing claimed back<br>
<br>
She knew it was only her<br>
<br>
But ghosts would explain <br>
<br>
The haunt <br>
<br>
Felt inside<br>
<br><br>
It’s almost as if<br>
<br>
And that’s that <br>
<br><br>
I’ll emerge from a parting<br>
<br>
Claimed small hairs<br>
<br>
They spring in autumn<br>
<br>
The leaves fell on her<br>
<br>
They call it fall<br>
<br>
She fall<br>
<br>
When the leaves were wet<br>
<br>
Like her eyes<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
I didn’t even <br>
<br>
I did<br>
<br>
It’s important to distinguish<br>
<br>
Flask from reality<br>
<br>
Pending on disguise<br>
<br><br>
He led her arms from flight<br>
<br>
In hope it would sustain her<br>
<br>
It isn’t his<br>
<br>
It’s hers <br>
<br>
She is what propels her<br>
<br>
But he’s part of her <br>
<br>
Own lives <br>
<br>
That make things <br>
<br><br><br><br>
IIII<br>
<br><br>
The room was filled with straight people <br>
<br>
They looked at one another <br>
<br>
In ways of saying <br>
<br>
It’s okay <br>
<br><br>
She held her burger<br>
<br>
For way too long<br>
<br>
She stimmed <br>
<br>
He researched <br>
<br>
The condiments <br>
<br>
We’re held in metal arms<br>
<br>
They had walked in<br>
<br>
Late<br>
<br>
Because she couldn’t <br>
<br>
As the burger <br>
<br>
From avoidance <br>
<br>
And ego<br>
<br><br>
Keep them waiting <br>
<br>
She thought <br>
<br>
As queer people <br>
<br>
Among a room of <br>
<br>
Is a force field<br>
<br>
That means one can look over<br>
<br>
And find solitude<br>
<br>
I support of together<br>
<br><br>
They shared a beer<br>
<br>
It was the best beer of his life<br>
<br>
She sipped <br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
It’s pretty good<br>
<br><br>
As they fermented <br>
<br>
On the seat <br>
<br>
In laughter <br>
<br><br><br><br>

He’s doing something interesting <br>

they took their presence elsewhere<br>
<br>
As she drove the vehicle<br>
<br>
Of direction<br>
<br>
To the store<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>I could still feel the intensity of his palms<br>
<br>
Creating a world together <br>
<br>
Through hand movement <br>
<br>
Placement <br>
<br>
In slept <br>
<br><br>

You can look over <br>
<br>
From a floor level<br>
<br>
His back doesn’t touch the metal<br>
<br>
Like hers did <br>
<br><br>
He never noticed <br>
<br>
Church’s on horizon<br>
<br>
His house was seen<br>
<br>
From behind the calender<br>
<br>
Or Saturday <br>
<br>
Where the slept <br>
<br>
And awoke <br>
<br>
In each others arms <br>
<br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
There is always <br>
<br>
And that’s what <br>
<br>
In feeling <br>
<br>
Morning hair <br>
<br>
Feels against her face <br>
<br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
It’s like the algorithm knows that we’re cute<br>

IIII<br>
<br><br>
His home was his room<br>
<br>
I learnt how to step over the step<br>
<br>
I was rhythms patterned <br>
<br>
She felt calm<br>
<br>
In the hallways of his mind<br>
<br>
Her mug was now hers <br>
<br>
When they sat<br>
<br>
In each other’s minds<br>
<br><br><br>
IIIII<br>
<br><br>
They looked at crickets<br>
<br>
They were yellow with black stripes<br>
<br>
Much like Zebras<br>
<br>
But different inform<br>
<br>
Inform us that we are different<br>
<br>
And what makes us interesting to others<br>
<br>
But we do not need<br>
<br>
When we have our own<br>
<br>
Much like bugs<br>
<br>
In metamorphosis<br>
<br>
Dreaming<br>
<br>
I dreamt of this<br>
<br>
When I couldn’t sleep<br>
<br>
So I wasn’t awake<br>
<br>
When lying next to you<br>
<br>
Because the dream<br>
<br>
had already begun<br>
<br><br>
It was time to start a course<br>
<br>
Learning how to hold bugs<br>
<br>
There was a fly that lived among us<br>
<br>
I wonder if he excretes into the air<br>
<br>
The scientist pending<br>
<br>
In the light of the hallway<br>
<br>
The wind of the place he sits<br>
<br>
The sun hits our faces<br>
<br>
A sense of unbound<br>
<br>
Hours spent in ways I never knew<br>
<br>
His circle palms<br>
<br>
Sprint around my fingers<br>
<br><br>
Let’s go this way<br>
<br>
He grabs her hand<br>
<br>
But it’s under a coat<br>
<br>
She thinks<br>
<br>
I will make my hand accessible<br>
<br>
For him<br>
<br><br>
When toothbrushes sit next to one another<br>
<br>
People wait in a line<br>
<br>
I hide a Calculator<br>
<br>
Because I am charming<br>
<br>
He doesn’t know I have bought it<br>
<br>
But he does<br>
<br><br>
When I am feeling comfortable<br>
<br>
I know who I am<br>
<br>
I know how to behave<br>
<br>
And I can show people who I am<br>
<br>
When he saw me<br>
<br>
I&nbsp; began to see myself<br>
<br>
As all of the writing<br>
<br>
Became clearer, clearer<br>
<br>
When she spoke <br>
<br><br><br>
IV<br>
<br><br>
All emotions<br>
<br>
Set within a bag<br>
<br>
That lay in my heart<br>
<br>
And slowly unraveled<br>
<br>
And gathered different feelings<br>
<br>
And more thought<br>
<br>
As time went on<br>
<br><br>
To spend<br>
<br>
It’s for us<br>
<br><br>
Do you like bowling?<br>
<br>
Do you like karaoke?<br>
<br><br><br>
His home bar<br>
<br>
Was hot<br>
<br><br><br>
She thought about him<br>
<br>
In the days edge <br>
<br>
As time would percured<br>
<br>
And come among the darkness<br>
<br>
All of the things she experienced <br>
<br>
Settled as of him<br>
<br>
As she surged <br>
<br>
Into the moments of present<br>
<br>
And lying down <br>
<br><br>
I opened the page of your poetry book<br>
<br>
And it was on the page of your poem<br>
<br>
It is a poem that perfectly eludes to the feeling of being trans<br>
<br>
And can emote feelings <br>
<br>
That incur a title <br>
<br>
This poem represents a moment when you feel your body differently <br>
<br>
But can’t always find what it is <br>
<br><br>
Dysphoria is a process <br>
<br>
Moving from one to another <br>
<br>
But not knowing what’s going on<br>
<br>
It’s important to know that he knew <br>
<br>
And was courageous in telling <br>
<br>
When I look at him <br>
<br>
I feel <br>
<br>
Because he knows <br>
<br>
What lives behind his eyes <br>
<br><br>
Frequencies <br>
<br>
Vibrate among the air between them <br>
<br>
He lays down <br>
<br>
And puts his legs across hers<br>
<br>
As they descended to read <br>
<br>
Something of importance <br>
<br><br><br>
My heart is beating faster as I write this<br>
<br>
Because I am gathering the feelings as I place them into mechanisms <br>
<br>
For understanding <br>
<br>
As I work it out <br>
<br>
Images appear in my mind <br>
<br>
For a slow time <br>
<br>
I’ll clean my teeth <br>
<br>
This is for him<br>
<br>
But also for myself <br>
<br><br>
My ego is large <br>
<br>
It’s hard to explain it away <br>
<br>
She says to someone<br>
<br>
“I’m really writing without ego”<br>
<br>
He says <br>
<br>
“It’s still there” <br>
<br><br>
His ego is <br>
<br>
And is what I like <br>
<br>
He knows what he wants <br>
<br>
And what he does is meaningful <br>
<br>
Because he is intentional <br>
<br>
And knows what he needs <br>
<br>
He knows who he is <br>
<br>
And knows where to sit <br>
<br>
He knows boundaries of time <br>
<br>
And never forgets the subtext of conversation <br>
<br>
He thinks and knows <br>
<br>
He bends for those around him<br>
<br>
But remains his own <br>
<br>
Everything is intentional <br>
<br>
So when something lands <br>
<br>
In his place for special objects <br>
<br>
It’s meaningful <br>
<br><br>
It’s why she can always pick the correct clown <br>
<br>
Because they know each other <br>
<br>
Because they take the time <br>
<br>
To see <br>
<br><br><br><br>
IIIIII<br>
<br><br>
I’ll read his poem again <br>
<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><h1>It wasn’t about them</h1><br>
<small><i>Grassy Beach</i></small><br>
<br><br><br><br>
Before the ages of seven she was not functioning in gender. She existed in a plain of existence that didn’t require understanding. When she was seven the recording of what she was, uncovered and as time went on she underwent a series of deepest sadness that would define her existence. This sadness is ever present and will always exist within her. She is clinically depressed, her psycho therapist said to her. She knew this. She is autistic so this means the original diagnosis would require less medication. She has ADHD and when her psycho therapist said to her “we’re giving you the diagnosis” she burst into tears. All the pain and emotion of not knowing, feeling like you may start to be able to live, revealed in front of her. The tears exist now. A series of diagnosis’s began to occur that would change the fabric of her existence, but this was just the latter stages. Her symptoms were subtle. She was quiet. She was seen as a boy. She was sensitive and would think of others. She was angry and would act out. She kicked her P.E. teacher in rounders because they had all laughed at her, she worked from revenge in moments like that. As she kicked him he looked at her and saw something. Her face was full of hurt and rage. He didn’t say anything because he knew that she was right to kick him, for what they had done earlier. But it wasn’t right for her to kick him hard on his shin as he passed. She didn’t get in trouble. That was when she passed. I am impulsive. Despite her calm exterior, lives a world of thought behind. Growing up she was never talking, didn’t open up, but would consistently throw the playstation remote, so<br>
<br><br>
 much so it shamefully would have a permanent rattle. She broke rackets in school playgrounds and kick fences and cry when she lost and could not look at the person who won. It could be seen that she was a sore loser, and maybe so, but what if she was. Autism comes out in many ways. In the middle of a meltdown there is no gap between the space between things. All gaps need a space and air provides this feeling, but with the lack of breathing, she doesn’t see the way life is. She has circulated in so many directions but can’t. It only stops when she hits. She hits her own head as hard as she can. The thoughts re align. She can wake up from her episode. The credits roll as the tears fall down her face. She bursts into tears and hides in the bathroom and places her head on the softness of the towels with rough surfaces so the customer doesn’t see her. She cries in pain, for fear of herself. She was conceptually possessed. There lay a demon inside of her, let's replace the word demon, here, with autism. Autism is what makes her phenomenal, autism is what hurts her, it's what connects her to people and it touches every moment of her existence. Her rage tames as the testosterone leaves her. Her vagina no longer gains erections. She no longer functions as men might, she never was. “How can you understand gender, when you can’t understand your autism?” Gender came first. A volcano was set to go off in a time where she could spill all over what she had touched. Her life was numb, lifeless and non-existent. She ran to see where she would end up. She ran away her breasts in the miles and miles she trained with. She numbed her brain with drugs and hurried it deeper and deeper inside her castle walls. She acted and became what she was supposed to, and yet, didn’t get the approval of others. She didn’t exist. She faded away. She was being choked by herself and she was slowly dying. In her last breaths, she<br>
<br><br>
 called out to speak to the imposter. “Don’t do this. I know I represent shame, but know that this will be only the beginning, you will find out that there is something inside of you, me, and it will all make sense. You need to believe me that after this is over, you will live, even if it feels like you will die, you won’t. You will meet people who will hurt you, assault you, take away parts of your humanity, but I am here to ensure you make it through, I am there to ensure you will always survive. When you want to end it all, when you feel it's all too much, I will provide a light, and this light will lead you to places and people and sensations you never knew would have existed. Right now, you feel like you are dead and stuck in your own incarceration. This is just your environment. I am going to get you out of here. You are going to go somewhere, else. You will be protected by me because although it will feel that everyone will give up on you at the beginning, if all of the family will leave you, your life will fall apart, you’ll feel you’ll never feel love, you’ll feel you’ll never feel like your life is your own, I will always be there with you. I won’t let you die. I won’t let you fall at the hands of what you will experience. Know that in nine years, it will all make sense.”<br>

She looked up and saw, when she heard, and posted a photo online. Messages came in. People told her to take it down. They were crying. They were scared. But she was free and she started the metamorphosis from one, to another. It didn’t matter how they felt, because it wasn’t about them.<br>

<br>{image 17}<br>
<br>
<br><small><i>The first time we met</i></small> <br>
<br><br>
You sat next to me<br>
<br>
And I saw you <br>
<br>
When he spoke <br>
<br>
About letting go<br>
<br>
Of those who raised us<br>
<br><br>
His shirt was conversation<br>
<br>
And through her sadness<br>
<br>
Their slowness started <br>
<br><br>
She went off to catch the bus <br>
<br>
She was crying because <br>
<br>
It felt impossible <br>
<br>
For someone like her<br>
<br><br>
And he appeared on the bus <br>
<br>
And she was <br>
<br>
And she saw <br>
<br>
And looked at<br>
<br>
His feeling <br>
<br>
Created change <br>
<br>
Within <br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Can I take you to my favorite place?<br>
<br>
I’ve not been in a while<br>
<br>
Because they were doing construction <br>
<br>
But <br>
<br>
I want to write from there <br>
<br>
And share a moment with you<br>
<br><br>
I made a skirt from tea towels<br>
<br>
I used safety pins to attach it<br>
<br>
And realized <br>
<br>
I need to sit down<br>
<br>
I have inspiration <br>
<br>
From various source <br>
<br><br>
Would you lay on a beach with me?<br>
<br>
And feel the sand beneath our towel on the ground <br>
<br>
I feel like the wind could calm ours ears <br>
<br>
As we float within our words <br>
<br>
In calmly calmly tide <br>
<br>
And suns that fade<br>
<br>
Eventually taking us inside <br>
<br><br>
I have a large scarf<br>
<br>
And we could sit on it<br>
<br>
Because it’s nice to create shapes in the grass edge <br>
<br>
Beside the grassy beach <br>
<br>
Area <br>
<br>
It’s around the place you can see the waters edge<br>
<br>
To feel a sense<br>
<br>
That it’s okay to do what we want <br>
<br>
In calm tide <br>
<br><br>
What a performance <br>
<br>
She said<br>
<br>
If only it was <br>
<br>
As she left and waved at the door <br>
<br>
Wondering how long <br>
<br>
Until <br>
<br>
They could talk about him <br>
<br><br><br><br>{image 16}<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><i><b>I sensationalized being</b></i> <br>
<br>
He<br>
<br>
My favorite poet <br>
<br>
In the room <br>
<br><br>
Shifted from left to right<br>
<br>
I remain seated <br>
<br>
Forgetting I have legs <br>
<br>
I don’t use <br>
<br>
So much <br>
<br>
When it’s personal<br>
<br>
I am becoming whole <br>
<br><br>
She thought of her favorite places<br>
<br>
They had distance apart <br>
<br>
Held by different memories<br>
<br>
She never visited them<br>
<br>
They were always, merely<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
She is intense <br>
<br>
High drama <br>
<br>
Attracting <br>
<br>
Like phera <br>
<br>
Singing in the bathroom <br>
<br>
When you feel safe <br>
<br><br>
They stood there <br>
<br>
In the midst of bathroom walls. <br>
<br>
Singing religious themes <br>
<br>
Among the walls <br>
<br>
Lay secrets <br>
<br>
And excretion <br>
<br>
It was contentious <br>
<br>
Among the lived <br>
<br><br>
Number five <br>
<br>
She said as she walked into the room <br>
<br>
Comfortable in shadow <br>
<br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
Do I become him<br>
<br>
As mirrored <br>
<br>
Is only reflection <br>
<br>
Heart beat still <br>
<br>
Among the place holders <br>
<br><br>
Her face is blank<br>
<br>
You’d never guess<br>
<br>
The amount she thought of<br>
<br>
And <br>
<br>
Because <br>
<br>
It’s a lot to ask <br>
<br><br>
His mind is still<br>
<br>
Gathers what’s still <br>
<br>
There among <br>
<br>
And does what he wants <br>
<br><br>
She does what she signed up<br>
<br>
And is often <br>
<br>
Without the <br>
<br>
But often with <br>
<br>
Mostly what she needed <br>
<br><br>
He slept there <br>
<br>
She didn’t understand present <br>
<br>
Being<br>
<br>
Among the table top <br>
<br>
She sat on a lower edge <br>
<br>
As his presence caressed her<br>
<br>
So <br>
<br>
As they ate whats left<br>
<br><br>
Put it all in a bag<br>
<br>
Let’s leave without <br>
<br>
When moment so <br>
<br>
I feel <br>
<br>
And in<br>
<br>
With singing in the<br>
<br>
Other rooms of passage<br>
<br><br>
It’s a lot <br>
<br>
When <br>
<br>
It’s real<br>
<br>
But it’s also a lot <br>
<br>
When it’s good<br>
<br><br><br>
IIIIIIII<br>
<br><br>
She sang like a bird in a room<br>
<br>
Her cage was no longer <br>
<br>
Helding with passage <br>
<br>
Under the bridge <br>
<br>
Is where all the items fall <br>
<br><br>
I could see<br>
<br>
When I passed by on the moving <br>
<br>
Vehicle, present <br>
<br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
It hurt inside <br>
<br>
She knew who<br>
<br>
And what is<br>
<br>
And those <br>
<br>
Twelve <br>
<br>
Wouldn’t ever know<br>
<br>
How it feels<br>
<br>
To treat someone <br>
<br>
With such a lack of respect <br>
<br>
She direct with intention <br>
<br>
As they darted <br>
<br>
Became their entertainment <br>
<br>
As she walked away<br>
<br>
No longer absorbing <br>
<br>
What mattered to them <br>
<br>
But what mattered to her<br>
<br><br>
To pass safely <br>
<br>
Without harm <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>{image 13}<br><br>
<br>
<br><small><i>I warmed up my jumper</i></small> <br>
<br>
To wear in your house <br>
<br><br>
I wondered if he would wear it too<br>
<br><br><br>
Sometimes memory <br>
<br>
Replaces others<br>
<br>
While being <br>
<br>
At a time<br>
<br>
And <br>
<br>
Something <br>
<br>
At the moment <br>
<br><br><br>
I<br>
<br><br>
When I feel I’m falling<br>
<br>
You always manage to catch me<br>
<br>
So I can find the strength<br>
<br>
To catch myself<br>
<br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
What are you (we) doing?<br>
<br>
Having a great time <br>
<br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
When sprinkle time<br>
<br>
Came in to settle<br>

<br><br>Sometimes she <small><i>thought</i></small> she was observing ghosts<br>
<br>
In and out the hallway<br>
<br>
A hand full of them could see<br>
<br>
As he moved his straight legs, left<br>
<br>
To right <br>
<br>
He returned and walked behind<br>
<br>
She moved incase <br>
<br>
He would move through her<br>
<br>
Out of respect <br>
<br>
If he was a ghost<br>
<br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
Deportation<br>
<br>
For those who stand <br>
<br>
This place holds hell<br>
<br>
Within its walls <br>
<br><br><br><br>
III<br>
<br><br>
Pensive<br>
<br>
It’s the only way to describe <br>
<br>
Her feeling of being cold<br>
<br>
Ina hot space<br>
<br>
Standing in lines<br>
<br>
Late <br>
<br>
Many times<br>
<br>
Her excuse is legible<br>
<br>
If you could read it<br>
<br><br>
The waiting room was full<br>
<br>
She began thinking of the week of end <br>
<br>
How this week<br>
<br>
Although improved<br>
<br>
Is improved, further <br>
<br>
With him in it<br>
<br><br>
She wondered how it all went<br>
<br>
She’ll find out soon<br>
<br><br><br><br>
IIII<br>
<br><br>
She is just melancholic <br>
<br>
It’s the medication <br>
<br>
It makes her<br>
<br>
Which is why she can<br>
<br>
But because her nose isn’t <br>
<br>
Doesn’t mean she can’t smell<br>
<br>
When it makes <br>
<br>
To see<br>
<br>
Scent<br>
<br>
And birds in the sky<br>
<br>
In among<br>
<br>
Floating balloons under her jacket<br>
<br>
Held<br>
<br>
Because they were his<br>
<br><br>
She thought about his hands<br>
<br>
And how they felt<br>
<br>
In circles of the time they spent <br>
<br>
When they were having their day <br>
<br>
Their lives <br>
<br>
Among many <br>
<br>
Activity <br>
<br>
But<br>
<br>
It’s nice. <br>
<br>
To know<br>
<br><br>
As the moon split in half <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>{image 12}<br>
<br><br><small><i>I like you</i></small>
<br>
And that’s where I like to live <br>

There’s a sun in the sky<br>
<br>
And it’s where the heat<br>
<br>
Accumulated into sweat <br>
<br>
Over hypothetical bodies <br>
<br><br>
There’s enough to <br>
<br>
When you look up<br>
<br>
Wondering if <br>
<br>
Dogs<br>
<br>
In religious spectrum <br>
<br><br>
They swirl around them<br>
<br>
In often circles <br>

Around their eyes <br>

I<br>

<small><i>I dreamt I was a dead bird</i></small> <br>
<br><br>
You are so<br>
<br>
And you make me feel so <br>
<br><br>
Hayfever is growing challenge <br>
<br>
As her nose felt blood<br>
<br>
Dried and curdled <br>
<br>
Internal, inside <br>
<br><br>
She got up to blow her nose. <br>
<br><br>
Her breasts hung like figs<br>
<br>
She slept on the tower he made<br>
<br>
Pomegranate orange <br>
<br>
Within internal <br>
<br>
As she processed <br>
<br>
The pollen of the day <br>
<br><br>
At the concert <br>
<br>
Her friend <br>
<br>
Spoke of<br>
<br>
And said he wouldn’t<br>
<br>
Unless more arrives <br>
<br><br>
A complimentary pizza <br>
<br>
For waiting<br>
<br>
She fell asleep on the table <br>
<br>
Awaiting her stuff to be stolen <br>
<br>
Alas <br>
<br>
It was merely seconds<br>
<br>
And the man looked at her for the first time<br>
<br>
Since her meltdown in the pizza shop<br>
<br><br>
I wonder if he noticed my breasts <br>
<br>
Under the double breasted jacket<br>
<br>
The day is ours <br>
<br>
And hours precious <br>
<br>
Moments to existual<br>
<br>
Once existential, prevail <br>
<br>
The two placed in places<br>
<br>
His lap so calm <br>
<br>
His hand up and down her hair<br>
<br>
As she felt like <br>
<br>
And talked <br>
<br><br>
I talked about you to my friend <br>
<br>
He was watching TV<br>
<br>
Because she was so entertaining <br>
<br>
With joy <br>
<br>
In description <br>
<br><br>
Her friend is a Leo<br>
<br>
She gave him her old meds<br>
<br>
So he could exist <br>
<br>
She wondered if it would make him feel better <br>
<br>
The way she does now <br>
<br><br>
Two breasts <br>
<br>
Lay on a <br>
<br>
The water trickles down the pipe<br>
<br>
She set to watch<br>
<br>
But why watch <br>
<br>
When we know the time<br>
<br>
Is spent, more, with thought <br>
<br><br>
His favorite Richard Linklater film<br>
<br>
Honestly slayed <br>
<br>
In green flagged memory<br>
<br>
A person unique <br>
<br>
Among the petals of eye-contact <br>
<br>
Desire <br>
<br>
For information <br>
<br>
Through the form <br>
<br>
It feels as though<br>
<br>
Life places the way for their continued <br>
<br>
She held off time as much as she could<br>
<br>
Because he <br>
<br>
Was important, is<br>
<br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
She was sensitive to power<br>
<br>
They say there on their chair they <br>
<br>
And pondered her contribution to the evenings<br>
<br>
I can fit you in <br>
<br>
As she sat there<br>
<br>
Her ego humbled<br>
<br>
Her feeling flowed <br>
<br>
As a third curtain revealed <br>
<br>
Some of the insights she searched <br>
<br>
She clicked her finger<br>
<br>
Once and <br>
<br>
Look at him<br>
<br>
She hoped he’d see her body language <br>
<br>
Because she knows he sees <br>
<br><br>
I want to land in his mind <br>
<br>
And see the room with his eyes<br>
<br>
The shirt that hangs from his shoulders <br>
<br>
She could smell him <br>
<br>
As they lay in triangles <br>
<br>
Among the duvet sheets<br>
<br>
Often her mind <br>
<br>
Would journey to his castle walls <br>
<br>
As he slept there <br>
<br>
Thinking about <br>
<br><br>
He left his cockroach earring <br>
<br>
She could feel the legs <br>
<br>
As she held it up to her eyes <br>
<br>
And saw she couldn’t touch it just yet<br>
<br><br>
They are skeletal <br>
<br>
Their organs inside are rotting <br>
<br>
But you cannot tell <br>
<br>
Hardened shell <br>
<br>
He makes me, heart beat faster <br>
<br>
Sprinting she runs in the shopping mall<br>
<br>
Through the crowds<br>
<br>
As if they were her audience <br>
<br>
In and out and between <br>
<br>
She would run until she couldn’t <br>
<br>
Because it felt good <br>
<br>
And she wasn’t <br>
<br>
So she could <br>
<br><br>
Since, how<br>
<br>
When you came <br>
<br>
She became what she self<br>

Inside<br>

It wasn’t hidden<br>
<br>
It was out<br>

In transition. <br>

Placement, <br>
<br>
Regarding <br>
<br>
,, how it feels <br>
<br>
‘Once the tide comes in <br>
<br>
Swept away <br>
<br>
Tangible, doubt <br>
<br>
With form expansion <br>
<br>
She considered her body <br>
<br>
As part of<br>
<br>
With his combed fingers <br>
<br>
Set within his palms <br>
<br>
And grey jumper <br>
<br>
Cockroach among them <br>
<br>
Hand with hand <br>
<br>
Over the presence of their <br>

Decorated in the feeling<br>
<br>
That life isn’t <br>
<br>
It’s actually <br>
<br><br>
And isn’t that so,, <br>

I would cry <br>

At how beautiful <br>

If I wasn’t so happy <br>

In the sensation of watching <br>

I’ll tell you why I love cars<br>

Isn’t everything coded<br>
<br>
Right? <br>

It’s so normale<br>

Isn’t it <br>

His stride <br>

Bare feet upon the soles <br>

And bio to remove <br>

They vacated <br>

For their own vacational purposes<br>

I feel emotion but do not cry <br>

She wonders of his hands <br>
<br>
In a lab <br>
<br><br>
Once she wore<br>
<br>
When she met three polish women<br>
<br>
Via different generations <br>
<br>
One her age<br>
<br>
One in the middle of life<br>
<br>
And one later on <br>
<br>
She only spoke to one<br>
<br>
And she had no idea <br>
<br>
Warum<br>
<br><br>
Sit<br>
<br>
It’s easier this way <br>
<br>
I listened to the past<br>
<br>
And it showed me glory<br>
<br>
of which <br>
<br><br>
My organs are compressed within <br>
<br>
Skeletal forces <br>
<br>
She craves bugs to invest all over <br>
<br>
And feel the legs on her body <br>
<br>
She want to know what it felt <br>
<br>
To see <br>
<br>
I could not touch<br>
<br>
Just yet<br>
<br>
As her body concurs with the rotting organs<br>
<br>
Of the cockroach <br>
<br>
A hardened layer <br>
<br>
I remember everything <br>
<br>
She was an elephant in a past life <br>
<br>
Ha ha ha <br>
<br>
Can’t you see how long my water nosed<br>
<br>
For wet<br>
<br>
Water<br>
<br>
Riding away from responsibility <br>
<br><br>
I will run away from paper<br>
<br>
And show you the door I see<br>
<br>
When I attempt to open<br>
<br>
I used to sprint in valleys <br>
<br>
But they are too high<br>
<br>
For my knees<br>
<br>
Set in branches <br>
<br>
Quiet<br>
<br><br>
As night falls <br>
<br>
Upon her face<br>
<br>
The stillness resides<br>
<br>
When her emotions un flare<br>
<br>
Kissing by the kitchen fridge <br>
<br>
Where else would it be?<br>
<br><br>
Dan had left<br>
<br>
And it was just them<br>
<br>
Depression doesn’t exist <br>
<br>
It’s just sadness<br>
<br>
He said <br>
<br>
Without considering <br>
<br>
Her perception of her own<br>
<br>
As she lay in sadness <br>
<br>
In the realms of welsh forests <br>
<br><br>
It was a walk up a hill<br>
<br>
They came to a clearing<br>
<br>
The dog would stop <br>
<br>
as clearing form<br>
<ul><li>I want to remember everything I’ve ever felt </li></ul><br>
As the dog stopped and wouldn’t proceed<br>
<br>
She was among a presence <br>
<br>
They follows her in<br>
<br>
And out her life, like<br>
<br>
The passing of souls she<br>
<br>
Find in another <br>
<br><br>
They didn’t proceed. <br>
<br>
The dog ran down<br>
<br>
And I followed<br>
<br>
The audio of sound<br>
<br>
Merely a representation <br>
<br>
Of something they felt<br>
<br><br>
I never knew what I saw<br>
<br>
I saw and felt nothing<br>
<br>
But everything <br>
<br>
Haunts of mind<br>
<br>
Presence of pleasure <br>
<br>
Inside her bones<br>
<br>
They rise with the night<br>
<br>
I lay in his hands<br>
<br>
For comfort <br>
<br>
In among<br>
<br>
Other the present<br>
<br><br>
I’m not going to talk about <br>
<br>
I will<br>
<br>
It’s here<br>
<br>
In a super <br>
<br>
There’s a place where they store it<br>
<br>
all<br>
<br>
They call it a brain <br>
<br>
It’s big <br>
<br>
Large<br>
<br>
You could even say it’s<br>
<ul><li>however unlikely</li></ul><br><br>
She woke up crying<br>
<br>
Ina pool of her own tears<br>
<br>
Her breasts swelling in the night<br>
<br>
THEY WERE FADING<br>
<br>
THEY WERE DISSIPATING<br>
<br>
I lay there<br>
<br><br>
Inside my own<br>
<br>
Seeing the calmness of now<br>
<br>
And realizing the<br>
<br>
Of the days edge<br>
<br>
As sad could creep<br>
<br>
If she wasn’t organized<br>
<br>
But isn’t it to feel<br>
<br>
She spoke<br>
<br>
It’s literally morning<br>
<br><br>
People are literally<br>
<br>
In the sun<br>
<br>
As they all cleaned their teeth<br>
<br>
And considered what<br>
<br>
As means of communication<br>
<br><br>
This is what I had<br>
<br>
It’s okay<br>
<br><br>
I never felt<br>
<br>
But as water passage<br>
<br>
She lifted<br>
<br>
Another trans person exists<br>
<br>
With autism<br>
<br>
It makes sense<br>
<br>
She needed courage<br>
<br>
Which only she would be providing<br>
<br>
In a space<br>
<br>
Devoid of emotion.<br>
<br><br><br>
Darkness is<br>
<br>
And that’s where<br>
<br>
Close breathing<br>
<br>
And set<br>
<br>
Look to the door<br>
<br>
And see<br>
<br>
What’s made<br>
<br>
When<br>
<br>
In mind<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
II<br>
<br><br>
I can’t seem to<br>
<br>
It’s so beautiful<br>
<br>
Emergence from<br>
<br>
He provided<br>
<br>
Sounds of wheels<br>
<br>
Passing cycles<br>
<br><br>
That is not a Porsche!<br>
<br>
But it says it is<br>
<br><br>
His theory<br>
<br>
An allegory<br>
<br>
It’s trans<br>
<br>
So trans<br>
<br>
She wept with listen<br>
<br>
As his theory prevailed<br>
<br>
She watched the trailer<br>
<br>
It made sense<br>
<br>
I would listen to you all day<br>
<br>
You’ll never lose me<br>
<br>
With the things you say<br>
<br>
Here, in tangle<br>
<br>
Of our own web<br>
<br>
We made<br>
<br>
Because it’s nice to not be the sad ones<br>
<br>
I want to experience forest with you<br>
<br>
And wake up to places that don’t have<br>
<br>
So we can just have time<br>
<br>
To exist<br>
<br>
The way we process<br>
<br><br>
And all proceeds<br>
<br>
Of the days passing<br>
<br>
Belong to us<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
