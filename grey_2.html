    Johanna school trip Wednesday, pack lunch 
<br><br>
    I was walking through a long, dark hallway and I could see a glow coming from a light at the end. As I walked the tunnel began to turn and I was 
    suddenly walking on the wall, then the ceiling, I turned a corner and came out into the living room, everything was very clean and neat but when I 
    looked closer there was a bright red spot on the carpet, the spot was Johanna, crying, and the skin on her arms and legs was lacerated, I 
    went to her immidiately but when I got there she was gone and in her place was the blue plastic tub for her toys. Then the family was coming into the 
    room; Markus and Zach, and I think my parents, too, but their faces were blurred, and then I was looking outside, watching the sun rise, and I felt calm somehow.

I'm feeling really good today! Everything has been going really well at school and at my after school activities too. I saw Celeste after 
school yesterday and we walked together to the park, then we bought ice cream from the 7/11 and we ate it there, it was so fun! Celeste said that 
she wanted to get a dog and I really hope that she does because then maybe we could walk it together. Today at school when I turned in my assignment 
Mrs. Carlson said that she really liked my writing and that I 'had a knack for it'. I couldn't believe it! I think Mom will really like my assignment 
too, since it's all about when she took me to the zoo. I think I'll show it to her when I get it back. Well, that's all for now!</i>
