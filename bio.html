Hunter Storm was born in 1999, raised in Enumclaw, a farm town outside of Seattle. He received a bachelor's in biology and German language at 
Portland State University before moving to Berlin in the fall of 2023. There, he started a master's program in 
evolutionary biology at the HU and began to focus on his other dream, writing. 
He works part-time at an insect laboratory in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde and spends the rest of his day writing prose and poetry. 
Their work typically deals with trans and queer themes, memory, and dreams. They take inspiration from 
surrealist and modernist writers like Franz Kafka and 
William Faulker, as well as early internet blogs and anonymous writing-sharing websites.
