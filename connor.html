Lee sits behind the bar counter, legs wound around the back of the chair. His knees and elbows protrude and reflect 
the line of incandecent bulbs hanging above, draping shadows on him like a strange web. His coworker, Eric, is wiping dust from the 
shelves of forgotten glasses on the back wall. Lee watches the door, it wavers in with the dregs of the night wind, slipping in and 
out of the latch, the papers stabled to the bulletin board shuffle each time, breathing like lungs. 
<br><br>
Eric hums to the buzz of the fridges, his hands weaving among the stacks of glasses. He keeps his back to Lee as he offers an offhand topic, 
one of several he liked to loop through on late nights like this. 
<br><br>
Hey, so, how are things going with - he paused as if to think - that one girl? 
<br><br>
Lee stretched his long arms in front of him, gripping his fingers and pulling them back one by one. He glanced up at the peeling 
wooden blades of the ceiling fan as it pushed the warm air around limply. 
<br><br>
Yeah, I'm not sure. I think we might be done, I mean I don't really think things are that serious. We met up on Thursday and I just 
wasn't feeling it. I mean she kinda pisses me off sometimes, ya know? He spoke quickly, unrehearsed, the words coming and falling 
into the stale air like dust, like nothing. 
<br><br>
Eric reached the end of the shelf and began working his way backwards, slipping his hand between each stack even slower now, 
prolonging the moment that he would need to find something else to pass the time. Yeah, I mean, it seemed pretty casual, how'd 
she piss you off? 
<br><br>
The fan blades spun so slowly they could be underwater. Lee wished they would spin faster, the slow turn was beginning to 
feel nauseating, he glanced out the window but it only reflected back the dim lights above his head, and his half lit face. 
<br><br>
She just thought she was something else, always trying to one up me or something, I'd say like, Oh I really like this band, 
and she'd come back and say she thought their lyrics were dumb, or she used to like them, or just something back handed. She 
was always undermining me, like when I said I was in a psychadelic rock band she was like 'Oh, you would be', but it was like 
in a shitty tone. I could just tell she had something going, like she hated me or something, even though she would ask to see me all the time.
