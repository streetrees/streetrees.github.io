            The blonde woman helps you at the jewerly store, <i>I don't know what she wants, I've already done everything</i>, have you tried 
            chocolate diamonds? You look while the man takes my arm, clasps on my grandmother's Rolex. When we walk to the car the security guard holds an umbrella 
            over my head. 
            <br><br>
            My grandmother gives me the watch first, the box already shaking in her hands when she comes around the corner. She says I am lovely as ever, 
            when the watch is transferred she can get to decorating, 
            she watches each plastic flower I place, telling me the stems are too long or too short. 
            I speak so softly no one can ever hear. 
            <br><br>
            The watch looks like any other watch. My father, <i>Give it to her now so she 
                can wear it.</i> the fake exasperation he does not even notice he uses, <i>we're having problems with the neighbors, they've made a real pit of that 
                    house, a saw a guy leaning over a bike in the driveway, in a drug stupor.</i> He emphasizes in the way that narcissists emphasize, making words sound 
                    disgusting. 
            <br><br>
            Turning up the hill and he is baiting me, he wishes to know, <i>and you know I don't agree with transgender men in women's sports, I call them men because they used to be 
                menâ€”</i> 
            <br><br>
            <i>Did you know I am transgender,</i> said the way I joke at work,

            The car is flashing, suddenly sliced entirely in half, like cut with light.
