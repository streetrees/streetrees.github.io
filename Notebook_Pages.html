Many things happen at once, in the shower this morning I stare at the overhead light too long and a blue ghost burns into my 
    vision, superimposed on the white tile, is it close or far from me? There is a haze in the air today, I can't tell if it's dust 
    from the new highrise being constructed down the street or the fog that feels a bit like being at the ocean, through these 
    small white particles I see a woman walking, cover your hair and your eyes then. 
<br><br>
I live in the house in my head. I used to think, I'm not sure if I do now. But something is different. My day does not move on a 
    track now, rather each second comes like bread from the bakery, seconds don't surprise me now, I have already seen them all. 
<br><br>
It's not easy to take your own life in your hands, what would it be like to take my own body in my hands and lead 
    myself like a horse through the fields? 
<br><br>
It feels like rain, welcome in, drifting home, I float, air feels thicker tonight and something calms 
me, maybe you? all feels well tonight, 'I'm going home', now I can float, more than that, all is well now, 
only counting minutes now, on my way home, the hand on my seat, 
locks without keys.
