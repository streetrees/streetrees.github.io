Coming home, the excrutiating drive, only red lights and I want to sleep at each one. I want to be away from this day and these buildings, fake brick and grey 
slats that say cheap and impermanent, buildings that will be bulldozed in five years and what will we do but make new grey walls with new square signs colored in 
new lighting schemes and I don't want to be still here to see it. 
<br><br>
Pull into the driveway and his car is out front, in the living room his cup is sitting on the counter, ice melted now into a ring on the wood, the house is cold. 
My glass is empty, I did sleep that night. 
<br><br>
A meeting this morning, they tell us about a new breakthrough, the machine has done something new, a gene intergrated not only within embryos now, 
they can inject the gene into a living adult, grown and mature, it was unexpected, the gene took, thick, hard plates began growing from his fingers, 
the formation wasn't perfect, the nails were strange and small, stopping and reentering the skin soon after they emerged, just fragments of the new material 
remembered now in the body, <i>but with more treatment</i>, they said. I sat in the voices of the other technicians, speaking about the medical applications, 
<i>with this, we could fix any ailment, any disease</i>. 
<br><br>
I thought of chitinous blades forming slowly beneath my skin, of two halves of the shell buckling, 
clasping together until I feel the tender hardness of another layer below, the rigidness and restriction of these two skins, my walk becoming strained 
as each brush of my legs together is brought closer, wider, my body thickening, and then the breaking, the release of the inner softness along its jointed 
lines, a soft shield breaking through the snapping lines of pink skin, I think of this moment of exposure, 
<br><br>
Another technician is talking to me, saying my name, asking something about the machine. I watch their mouth, spit bubbling at the corner and now they are 
asking about me, now the meeting has ended, 
<br><br>
<i>yes, my weekend was fine. I didn't do much</i>, I don't talk about the glass, the glass still sitting on the counter, the only evidence that he still lives there, 
I don't say he didn't come home at all last night, that I didn't really sleep, just heard my alarm at one point and saw the light of the TV still moving, and 
the sun coming in sheets, warming my face and the floor and coating the room in yellow and that I felt afraid.
