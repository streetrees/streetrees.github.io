<b> I GOTTA GET TO WORK </b>

So there I was, I Was Trying To Get To Work. It was a sunny afternoon in October: coldish, crunchy leaves; and I just simply 
HAD to get to work at my service desk job at the Home Depot in Clackamas Oregon. The wind was loose and cool and sparkling
drops of rain flittered about the trees but all I could think about was It was 3:45 and they needed me at the 
service desk because at 4 pm WHO would be there to help all of those friendly, loving, kind people lined up waiting to begin 
various home improvment projects such as: 
upgrading the dishwasher, buying a 2x4, new viynl flooring!, or maybe letting me know that 'This Tile In The Box Of Tiles Is Broken'. 

It was definitely important that I get to the service floor, and soon!  So I put on my helmet, stringing my earrings 
through the straps, and started my ride down the Springwater Cooridor (reputation precedes) when all of a sudden my bike tire punctured 
a pup tent strung in a small 
triangle across the asphalt. UM, Sorry! I said and started edging my tire around the tent when suddenly I had the sensation of falling. 
The tent had obscured a large crack in the asphalt that can only be described as a steep cravasse, my bike and I (I remained upright)
slid through this hole together before the walls became too narrow and we slid to a stop. Luckily, I could still see light from the 
top of the tunnel, although barely. I thought of the service desk, how many people were probably entering the line at that very moment, 
and I groaned, the clock was ticking! In only ten more minutes my coworker, Maurice, would be clocking out leaving exactly 3 people 
at the service desk; the service lead, Susan; and my fellow associates, Bryan and Jeff. I knew at that moment that if I did not 
get out of this mess in the next few minutes, the entire Clackamas Home Depot Customer Service Department could be in jeopardy.
I shivered, the walls of the cravasse were a mix of medium-sized smooth river rock and thick mud. I thought about calling out but 
thought better of it, by entering Springwater Coordidor I had already given up my right to rescue. Instead, I would need to use the 
knowledge 
I gained in my extensive Home Depot Associate Training Courses to get out of this. I looked ahead in the dark cavern and noticed a 
hole in the rock about the size of a 4x4 sheet of plywood. I dismounted my bike and crawled through the hole, as I wiggled my body 
through the rocks like a drill bit I noticed that the passage began to widen and I entered what felt like a cavern. I shown my bike light 
around the arching stone and mud but saw no immidiate escape, only the entrance to what must have been a vast cave system.
