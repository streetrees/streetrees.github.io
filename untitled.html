<b>I felt like a doll.</b> M drove us to 
Cable World around 5 pm as the sun lowered on buildings that stretched in grey white storefronts and corporate signs and parking lots that could have been in 
a Tumblr post back in the day. Cable World sat between the JU JITSU place with the green-belt family silhouettes and the travel agency with resin-blue tropical fish window art. Inside was 
white-walled desolation and product signs printed out on yellow printer paper and taped to PVC pipes. Just floor tiles, HDMI hybrids, and LED lighting. Behind the counter 
were hundreds of signs the owner had found on Facebook and printed out, such things as 'Working out give you the confidence to dance naked, then again so does 
Tequila'. A man came in before we could ring up our cables and started talking to the owner, saying 'sorry kids' and telling the guy about his T.V. hookup 
problem, their tone made me feel that they were in love. Later we drove home as the moon back lit the clouds, making them turn to blue blankets over the 
strip malls turned plastic as the workers slept, back again in their apartment complexes and fumbling with the wires crawling from the walls. The blank framed 
portraits, purple mountains, above our beds.

<b>I felt like a doll.</b> It was 5 pm on a Tuesday when we drove to <i>Cable World</i>, slipping down into the valley, to a place shoved between a Ju Jitsu place and a 
travel agency. Window art announcing each presence, casting a colored glow into the street in the shapes of mother, father, child, gi'ed and standing 
with balled fists, elbows raised past the head and eternally waiting, to punch down- or an aeroplane, blue and white hovering over the beige desk seen through the 
window, staying put with the promise that you, instead, will be in the shoals of rainbow fish, but of these imagined futures, we instead entered <i>Cable World</i>, 
so grey it was perhaps a structural member of the stripmall itself, perhaps only placed for municipal workers to access the breakers, marked, lit, in red italics,
