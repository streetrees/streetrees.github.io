character notes:

anne ? something?

how tall are you?
    I'm 5'4''

how old are you precisely?
    I'm exactly 25 years old 

what color is your hair? is that the natural color?
    I bleach my hair sometimes, right now its fading out and doesn't look great, but I'll probably go back in for a touch up soon. 

how do your eyes look?
    what kind of question is this? my eyes look like eyes, I actually like their green color though. people often comment on them. 
    I do have some bags under them I guess, sometimes I don't sleep very well. 

what is your skin color?
    I'm a white woman. 

what do you like to wear?
    I dress nice, even though most people don't even see me come in. I have these nice black slacks I like, and usually a work shirt. 
    I like to wear green, since I think it looks nice with my eyes and stuff. Also, I like to wear baggier clothes, no need to be 
    seen more than I need to be. 

How do you move when you're walking down the street? 
    Is this a psychological study? I like to think I look confident walking down the street, but I know I probably don't. 
    I shuffle my feet a bit and look down when people go by. I'm usually hurrying to work or to the bus or something so I 
    don't exactly look graceful. 

Do you have an outstanding feature? 
    










waking here by bonfire flames 
rasp revolt the smoke climbs in
haunting lip pink throats 

fire lights your neck, 
crouching morning sun behind
all bruised eyes in hillsides

land calls out from our new center
meet my eyes - the edge of glass
stars tear 'round our circle 

black fields of starved  
prairie town skeletons 
dead weight in hot wind 

drive me out just drive me out 
leave me rotting in the road 

can't go back we can't go back 
morning scrapes our eyes 

drive and drive 
but it's still here 
green of the dashboard light 

drive and drive 
but it's still here 
green of the dashboard light
