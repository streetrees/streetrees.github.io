anne ? something?

what color is your hair? is that the natural color?
    I bleach my hair sometimes, right now its fading out and doesn't look great, but I'll probably go back in for a touch up soon. 

how do your eyes look?
    what kind of question is this? my eyes look like eyes, I actually like their green color though. people often comment on them. 
    I do have some bags under them I guess, sometimes I don't sleep very well. 

what is your skin color?
    I'm a white woman. 

what do you like to wear?
    I dress nice, even though most people don't even see me come in. I have these nice black slacks I like, and usually a work shirt. 
    I like to wear green, since I think it looks nice with my eyes and stuff. Also, I like to wear baggier clothes, no need to be 
    seen more than I need to be. 

How do you move when you're walking down the street? 
    Is this a psychological study? I like to think I look confident walking down the street, but I know I probably don't. 
    I shuffle my feet a bit and look down when people go by. I'm usually hurrying to work or to the bus or something so I 
    don't exactly look graceful. 

Do you have an outstanding feature?
