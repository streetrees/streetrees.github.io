'Oh Rosemary? Do you have time to take a look at those samples I brought in last week? Only if you have time, of course. They aren't super urgent, 
I just need some data to send back to the client, he's hoping to build some sort of structure over that pond and I guess they're hoping to start 
construction relatively soon so.. ''

'Yeah, sure, I'll have some time later today.' Rosemary most certainly did not have time, she had gotten in to work later than usual and was frantically trying 
to work through her daily rotation of mail and categorizing the data reports from the last week. Not to mention sending follow up letters to her 
big clients, that would take hours. But she just tried to smile and push the papers into an overflowing stack on the edge of her desk. 

Her boss, Jon, sensed none of this and happily took leave of her office, noting the color of her blouse before he left, she looked nice today. He thought. 

Rosemary had been delayed coming in to work by a wash out on I-94 that morning. As she sped down the last stretch of road towards Dellinger Treatment she had 
almost rear ended a line of stopped cars waiting their turn to cross a section of flooded road. She patiently waited her turn while the rain continued to splatter her 
toyota corola and flood the fields on either side of the road, only increasing the spread and depth of the washout. By the time she slowly and carefully drove over the 
now lake-sized puddle she was over an hour late for work. 

But no matter, she would surely get the samples fixed before Jon left that afternoon. It was the least she could do for having such a generally kind and caring boss, 
she knew her collegues at other plants always had stories about their managers being overly demanding or taking no interest in their personal development, 
such was definitely not the case with Jon and she was deeply appreciative. He always came in to check on her progress at least once and often twice a day, 
giving her tips on how to improve her identifications or her fixings. She'd been at the lab for over four years and had learned so much during that time, and she 
knew that it was only a matter of time before Jon would ask her to take over a bigger role in the lab. Her current manager, Jesse, was getting ready to leave 
the plant and start as the head supervisor of a large chemical company. It was such an amazing opportunity and Rosemary was grateful to have gotten to work 
under him, but secretly she was hoping that she would be picked to take over the managment position at Dellinger once he was gone. 
However, she found this particular thought a bit ugly so she tried her best to just focus on her work and trust that bigger opportunites would come when she was ready. 

Still, Rosemary was daydreaming about the extra income she might have if this course of events was in fact to happen while she got out the samples Jon had 
wheeled in on the plate-cart that morning. Her preoccupation may have been what caused her to accidentally begin with a sample from the bottom of the cart 
instead of the top. Rosemary always started with the top samples because they were taken from the shore and the shallow mud of the water body. The samples 
at the bottom of the cart were generally from the deepest sections of the water and were not tested for organisms. Sure, lots of the organisms live in the 
deep water and largely undisturbed silt at the bottom of freshwater systems, but these organisms were usually less identifiable than those from the shore habitats, 
there was no reason for Rosemary to waste her time looking at bunch of taxonimically ambiguous and sometimes even undescribed organisms, she was just an analysist, 
not a researcher for gods sake. This was another great thing about Jon, he always made sure that she was aware of exactly where her duties ended, no reason to 
waste time looking at organisms that even Jon and his fellow aquatic microbiologists could not identify. The clients generally didn't care about the microbiological 
samples of their water either, 'just give them the quality measures and call it a day' was what Jon often told her when she started fixating on the 
more minute details in the samples. 

However, today Rosemary took a deep water sample and put it directly on a slide, not noticing her mistake as she shoved the slide under the microscope and 
got out her record sheet to begin dicating the various bacterial and planktonic species. At first the sample did not look very different from the usual 
shallow water samples, it was largly devoid of any swimming or even sessile animals, just many grains of silt that were disturbed during collection, but empty 
samples were also commonly found in shallow water. It took a few minutes of moving the slide around the microscope stage for her to see something 
amiss. Embedded in the field of silt grains was a small organism, curled in a ball like a tiny spiral. 
The organism had strange characteristics, a large head and what even looked like minature curled limbs. Rosemary quickly switched to a higher magnification and 
looked more closely at the unknown organism, it was what she had initially thought, the species had the shape of a branching leaf with strange hand-like 
growths extendingly from the tips of the branches. The hands continued branching, five fingers splitting farther and farther until Rosemary could no longer 
the distinquish the digits even at the highest magnification, but she could see that they continued, each finger entending to another hand. The organim 
itself was radially semetrical, appearly like five fingers fused at the base. 

She switched back to the small magnification and examined the slide for more of the strange growths. She could only see the one, the only other living 
specimens were a few rotifers and a slow amoeba making it's way towards the edge of the slide. The growth was exceptionally unique, and although Rosemary 
had since realized that she had been examining the wrong plates all along she felt it was now her responsibility to notify Jon that she had discovered a 
biological oddity. She left the growth and the slide exactly as it was and went up to Jon's office. Jon worked on the fifth floor of Dellinger, his windows 
opening up to sweeping views of the river and surrounding plains, Rosemary worked in the basement and always found herself startled when she entered Jon's 
office and saw the daylight from outside. 

'Jon, I have something I'd like to show you down in the lab.' It had already been a stressful day and Rosemary struggled to keep her composure as she 
interrupted Jon sitting quietly at his work computer, clicking through what she imagined was very important correspondence. Jon turned in his chair 
and looked over at her questioningly, 

'Something to show me? Is it a problem with the samples I gave you?' 

'No, it's not a problem it's just something strange' Rosemary wasn't sure why but she was beginning to feel a strong urgency, it suddenly seemed 
extremely important that Jon come down to the lab immidiately. Her palms began to sweat and she wiped them conspicuously on the sides of her pants. 

'Alright' Jon began to notice Rosemary's distress and felt a bit wary. He hadn't really been looking at any of his unread mail from collegues or 
any of the requests they had been sending him, although that is what he should have been doing. Instead, Jon had been carefully typing out a letter to his 
wife. That night, or perhaps next morning, he hoped to leave the letter in a place she would find it, probably the table by their bed, and he would drive 
to his boyfriend's apartment. Together they would drive across the country to a house that they had already paid the rental deposit for in Tallahassee, Florida. 
Jon was so set on making this decision, one that he had mulled over for over half a year at this point, that he found the 
final letter to his wife actually quite easy to write. Still he worried that if he followed Rosemary to find out whatever ridiculous problem she was having he would
struggle to get back into his groove. 

'I'm actually a bit busy at the moment but I'll be down shortly.' Jon mustered an unconvincing and dismissive smile and waited for Rosemary to retreat. 

Rosemary was used to Jon's very demanding schedule and tried to empathize with his dismissal of her. 'Of course, he's extremely busy, he surely will come the 
minute he has some free time' Rosemary told herself and dazedly made her way back to the basement. When she sat back at her desk and started to examine 
the slide again she was startled to see a black speck floating under the slide protector. The sample had been completely clear before, how had this black spot 
appeared under plastic slide cover? She peered through the microscope and held back a scream, the strange organism had expanded, 
no longer a faint spiral amidst the fine grains it now engulfed the entire sample, at the lowest magnification she could now make out the digit segments and 
could view far more layers of branches, the individual fingers were almost visible with the naked eye when she looked back at the slide. 

The organim's dramatic change greatly disturbed Rosemary and she instictively stood to go back to Jon's office. She caught 
herself though, she couldn't go back and demand his attention when she was trying to prove to him how level-headed and capable she was. She needed to present herself as 
a calm and unproblematic technician. Jon probably knew exactly what this strange organism was and would explain to her exactly the mechanism of it's quick growth, he 
would laugh at her for acting so hysterical and would begin to distrust her judgement. That would assuredly cause her many more problems than whatever little 
microrganism was still only a speck on her slide. 

It was at this moment, while Rosemary had been looking away from the microscope and towards the door, arguing with herself, 
that the organism expanded first to the size of a quarter, then a human hand, then reached out from the microscope and slumped it's limbs over the 
table, the fingers appearing now like arms and legs, growing exponentially and completely engulfing Rosemary in the split second between making contact with her 
knee neatly crossed in the chair and doubling in size, she had only just noticed the horror of the limp skin spreading over her like a starfish when she 
was consumed. 

As the skin of the being stretched around Rosemary she could see light still penetrating through, like seeing light through her eyelids. Then it was over, and 
she was again looking at her lab table, the microscope in front of her, the small room was again completely undisturbed. Rosemary looked around and saw a thin layer of 
skin disappear through the metal wall on the side of the office. 

Rosemary felt her clothes, her legs, her face. Everything felt normal, clean, dry. She looked down at the slide, stunned, and of course, found the water now 
completely empty except for the silt and the same stationary rotifers and ameoba hanging on the edge of the slide cover. Rosemary blinked and stared at the table, 
her face was contorted in shock and she stood there motionless a few seconds before slowly turned to the door and gingerly stepping into the hallway. 
The white brick walls of the hallway looked so ordinary, as did the door to the neighboring lab and the bathroom that Rosemary slowly made her way to, running her 
fingers down the wall as she went. When Jon finally came to a stopping point on the fifth page of his letter and made his way down to the basement 
he found Rosemary sitting on the floor in the hallway, her legs pointed straight in front of her and her eyes slightly glazed, just staring at the white bricks across 
from her. 

'Rosemary?' Jon was alarmed, she was usually such a reliable lab worker, he had never known her to get sick on the job or have any sort of anxiety. He immediately 
conclused that she must have spilled some toxic chemical in the lab and had experienced some level of gaseous poisoning. 

'What's going on? Are you alright?' Jon was pulling her to her feet and Rosemary limply obligued, slipping on the floor tiles as she got to her feet. 

'Jon, I don't think I'm okay.' her voice wavered and Jon saw tears forming in her eyes, her mouth stretched into a frown and suddenly she was hysterical. 

'I just saw something in the lab, I don't know what happened, I think I'm going crazy or something, because' she closed her eyes and sobbed, 'there was 
something growing on the slide and then it just, I don't know what happened but it..' Rosemary realized she could not possibly put words around what had happened, she 
just cried and stood there in the hallway as Jon lamely put his hand on her shoulder and tried to subtly move it to her back to begin pushing her towards the 
stairwell. 'I just need to get her to fresh air' he thought, both trying to hold his breath and lightly smell for what he assumed was carbon monoxide or perhaps 
a spilled bottle of concentrated formaldyhyde.
