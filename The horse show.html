The horse show is full of silver and gold medals. The horse stalls are marked with the ribbons, they are pined on the metal grates. Horses with many big blue 
ribbons are the most hard to see, looking like dark shadows behind the walls. Some women sell dogs in small corals, they ask us to look as we walk past.
 Another woman is selling essential oils for our horse. She tells us she can talk with lost dogs and tell us our horse's past lives, <i>if 
you ever need that sort of thing. </i> She speaks fast and never slows down to let us tell her we barely have a horse, only a pony. 
<br><br>
The oils have names like <i>Charity</i> and <i>Heavenly Oasis</i>. She lets us hold a black bottle called <i>Victory</i> and says we need to put a drop on our horses 
harness before she competes tomorrow. <i>She'll stay focused and listen better, it's the secret, all the winning horses you see today are using something like 
    this. </i> The bottle is $25 but we still look at it for a while, Mandy holds it in her hand and turns it slowly. She asks, 
    <br><br>
    <i>You said you can talk with dogs and horses even after they've, passed away... how does it work?</i>
    <br><br>
    The woman leans forward, she smiles over her rows of oils and her glasses fall slightly to the tip of her nose. Her white hair is pulled and shaped into 
    a perfect sphere on top of her head, like a pearl. 
    <br><br>
    <i>
        It's a service I offer. I have a feeling you're grieving someone right now, someone ran away?
    </i>
    <br><br>
    Mandy watches the bottle rolling in her hand. <i>Yes, my cat, Sofie. She's been missing for over a year now.</i>
    <br><br>
    The woman looks concerned, she reaches across the table and pets Mandy's hand slightly. <i>She was your best friend wasn't she? I can see that 
        so clearly, you had a soul bond. When I commune with lost family members I speak to them wherever they are, whether on Earth or in Heaven, I 
        will be able to ask Sofie herself what happened, and tell you what she is feeling right now. 
    </i>
    <br><br>
    Mandy meets the woman's eyes and gives her a light smile. The woman continues, <i>I can see that you have been grieving intensely. Perhaps that is because 
        Sofie is trying to speak to you, and once you can talk to each other, the pain will be eased. 
    </i>
    <br><br>
    Mandy nods, <i>I know something bad happened, I just wish I knew what. Like, if it was something I did that was preventable.</i>
    <br><br>
    Mandy puts the bottle back on the table and looks towards me, I try and move my head to leave without letting the woman see. It works, and we thank her 
    one after the other. She looks down at us with knowing eyes and says she'll be there the whole show, <i>in case you have more questions.</i>
    <br><br>
    We go back to the ring of blue heelers. They jump over each other trying to reach us.

    Mandy's mom is waiting at the trailer. She's sitting in a blue camp chair and looking up at the sky with a odd expression. In her hand is a bright green 
    bottle, half full. 
    <br><br>
    <i>What were you girls up to?</i> she asks, still facing the sky. She looks like she's searching the branches of the trees above us. 
    <br><br>
    <i>In the big barn, just looking at the horses.</i> I answer for both of us, Mandy is looking back down the road we came, she puts her hands in 
    her pockets. Mandy's mom laughs unnaturally,
    <br><br>
    <i>Yeah, that sounds great, hanging out with the evangelicals, did they tell you how to get into heaven?</i>
    <br><br>
    All of her words are lengthened, taking up space in the air. The trailer is bright in the sun and the white paint is blinding behind her. 
    <br><br>
    Mandy turns back to us quickly, 
    <br><br>
    <i>Yeah, they told us exactly how. I bet you wish you knew.</i>
    <br><br>
    Her mom laughs again, the sound spaced too far apart, 
    <br><br>
    <i>My daughter thinks she knows everything. My sweet little girl can tell her mom how to live now, she's old enough. </i>
    <br><br>
    Mandy looked her mother in the eye, the woman squared her shoulders in the lawn chair and smiled, her lips twisting showing the tips of her 
    teeth, her skin hung loose and seemed to change too much with every expression, her eyes were only half open. 
    <br><br>
    <i>I wish I knew as much as you,  </i>
    <br><br>
    Mandy's mom takes a drink and smiles, <i>I wish you did too.</i>
    <br><Br>

<br><br>
At some point a proposal was made, I always remember her mom standing the kitchen under a harsh yellow
incandencence, as though the blinds had always been closed. And as things happen in childhood it had happened, and we had at some point arrived alone at 
the trailer in a now forgotten part of Washington, Mandy letting herself in with her aunt's key. 
<br><br>
The center of the trailer was a black carpet, and again I remember only a dark room, there was only the sunlight outside and a dark trailer, the overhead lights 
wavering at night, often clicking off for a moment. We decided to fish in the morning, neither of us having caught a fish before. We wore large sweaters and sat 
on the dock, me holding the fishing pole, Mandy only sitting and watching. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
<i>What do you think will happen when we're older? I don't know what will happen with my mom, she's so erratic sometimes, she's always unhappy, I can tell. It's 
    her own fault too, she can be as unstable as my dad, I think she's a narcissist, or something like that.  </i>
<br><br>
My voice always got lower when I spoke to her, <i>I could see that, like while she was taking us down to Camas, she got angry at the 
    other drivers so easily, and even when we got to the show she seemed tense I guess, something is definitely bothering her, it could be your dad of course,  
</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yeah, but some of it is still her fault, that was so funny going to the horse show, it was so weird having you there, observing everything. </i> 
<br><br>
<i>It was good seeing it from the inside, it helped me understand,</i>
<br><br>
<i>She's also way better when you're around, when it's just us she'll come in my room and start yelling, she's always so high strung and always pissed about 
    something. 
</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yeah, I mean, she has a lot to be mad about. </i>
<br><br>

Three fish bit the entire weekend. It took eight hours before we got the first, we'd switched from using real worms to plastic worms to nothing at all, 
just throwing the hook in the water and leaving the pole leaning against the railing. We waded into the mud at the lakeshore and felt for crawdads, 
when we found them we put them in our bucket, they spent all day crawling up the sides. At some point I looked up and noticed the 
pole bending towards the water, pulling and releasing in silence under the grey sky. It took another day before we were able to keep a fish on the line, 
when we saw it darting in the water we saw it was barely larger than the plastic worms. We pulled it up and put it in the bucket anyway. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
An old house stood across from the lake. A dark wood box floating in an ocean of dry grass. The grass rippled in the wind against the empty windows, 
the roof was slowly melting, glowing in the sun, from the road you could even make out the doorway. I was alone the first time I went to 
the house. I picked through the tall grass and 
watched the house take shape ahead of me, the roof sprawling and molding to the remaining posts like a blanket. The grass blew softly 
around the remains of the porch, and I watched as a snake moved beneath the wood. Through the grass I could see the wide open doorway, but I stopped, 
and went no further. 
<br><br>
I imagined the dark house with the tall windows, it had looked abandoned even while they lived there. I'd never gone in the basement, where she said her dad 
slept. 
<br><br>
<i>He barely comes out, he doesn't have a job, just stays down there sleeping or drinking.</i>
<br><br>
The house was

I'd seen Mandy at the drug store earlier that day. It was the first time I'd seen her in months, she turned towards me in the aisle and our eyes met, hers were 
wide and sunken, her skin looked green under the flourescent lights. 
<br><br>
I would see her one more time, it was later that night. I'd heard someone at the gas station saying marker 88, so I went. As I pulled up my headlights 
landed on Mandy sitting in a plastic lawn chair, talking to a man I didn't recognize. Everyone was crowded around a fire, someone had brought a big speaker 
and the whole party was lit up with the lights of the trucks around, it all soaked into the pines and was absorbed into the woods. She looked over when I walked 
up, 
<br><br>
<i>I went back to that woman from the horse show, the one who could read past lives.</i> 
<br><br>
<i>Did you find out anything?</i>
<br><br>
<i>She told me Sofie got eaten by a coyote. She died in the morning, on the first day she went missing. </i>
<br><br>
I searched her face but she showed no emotion, her eyes were clear and only reflected the red glow of the fire. 
<br><br>
<i>Did it help to talk with her?</i>
<br><br>
<i>It was good I think, it was nice to really know what happened, and I'm glad it was a coyote, she was too smart to get hit by a car or something. </i>
<br><br>
<i>How much did it cost?</i> 
<br><br>
<i>It was $200, but it was worth it.</i>
<br><br>
She took a drink, the bottle was dark blue and looked nice in the dark shine around us. 
<br><br>
The person next to her joined in then, he was someone I knew from school but had never talked to, he had a wide face so I guessed he was a football player.

<br><br>
In the months after they left I sometimes forgot that she'd moved. I rode my bike to her old house and waited, then remembered when I saw the blinds on the 
windows. I hadn't gone in that house often, but I remembered the kitchen, bright bulbs and framed paintings of barns and fruit baskets, her mom's blonde 
hair looked white in the overhead light. 


<!-- <br><br>
I sat down and let the music drown out my voice, I spoke too soft, 
<br><br>
-------------
<br><br>
It hadn't been easy for her. I didn't want to push her into explaining what it had been like, since I had my own assumptions. I could picture the tall windows 
of that house, and the long driveway, how it felt abandoned even the months that they lived there.

From the railing I could look over the floor of the machine shop, a large magnet hung above to pull the scrap from the heap of cars below. Someone was at the 
controls when I came in, dangling the magnet and mining slowly over the pile. Black wires began to seep out and knots of metal 
fused together by the force of the crane. The strands hung down like hair from the metal disk, and were pulled into the air. 
<br><br>
I watched the operator release the metals onto the belt, where they rushed away into the hot rooms, but I saw nothing out of the ordinary. The wires were 
separated and lifeless and they dropped from the magnet, and did not converge, even for a moment. 
<br><br>
I went down to the machine floor and went into a blank grey door on the wall nearest the magnet. Inside was a small storage room we left items of value, 
mostly catalytic converters, but also non-metal items we occasionally pulled from the cars. I knelt below the table and pulled out a cardboard box, inside 
was a green blanket, still softly moving. 
<br><br>
The pale fabric stretched and unstretched in measured time, as though the contents were only a motor. But as I unwrapped the blanket, the metal pieces 
inside slowed and became still again in my hands.
