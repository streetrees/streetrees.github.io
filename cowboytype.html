Standing at the counter. He came in wildly, grey hair everywhere and of course I'd soon know that was part of him, Silver Coyote. 
<br><br>
1001 sentences, 1001 things to say and none of them good, he said. There were cartons of cigarettes behind me, 
<br><br>
<i>Can I have that?</i>
<br><br>
<i>Marlboro reds?</i> He said he loved the 100s, they're smoother, scans hotdogs resting on the grease to our left, spinning slower than usual, <i>nap, 
    time for an afternoon nap
</i>
<br><br>
<i>What's up with you anyway?</i> I couldn't believe it, I could, they always talked to me like this, like we were best friends and 
they weren't just drunk on a Wednesday afternoon coming in to buy smokes and finding me forced to respond. Silver hair is falling on the counter, 
his lips torn in deep chapped groves, spit residue in the corners of his mouth, his eyes though, blue and too wide. 
<br><br>
<i>Just tired</i>, I'm lying, I don't care, Silver Coyote notices, maybe he's not as gone as I thought, 
<br><br>
<i>No, No, you're upset. </i> Crooked little grin, mouth corners twitching and pulling, nose scrunched up like a rat, <i>I can 
    always see these things</i>
<br><br>
God, and it's not like I'm not used to this. Another weird motherfucker now my daily regular, can't wait to give the cheery, Hiya! 
tomorrow and forever, until I leave this Earth or maybe just this job, sunlight shines in the half closed blinds, our cheap fan in the corner 
wirring and spinning away, I think: what do people like this even do all day.
