A grey ship extends from the asphalt downtown, its bow peaking into the low clouds, its sides turning and falling away at sharp angles. I could never go into it, 
only sit with my mother at the pond below, on the most special days she would take me with her to the edge of the water. 
<br><br>
I wondered often what she did when she left the pond, left the slowly circling ducks and rode the elevator to her office. I pictured her looking out a window 
into the fog. I could not understand why she left, as the people next to us kept throwing bread and the birds kept snapping it from the water. 
<br><br>
Later they would find the ship had never been stable, that no one had ever bothered to learn how to fill the ballast tanks so the hull was always underfilled, tending 
to tip. It had always worked so far, the people like my mother coming in and going away, doing the calculations would only have showed how precarious it all was, 
hanging above the neighborhoods, the metal twisting in the wind at night.   
<br><br>
When my mother was late coming home I would start to cry. It wasn't fair she could go before I even knew her. I could feel that even when she was home she was often far away. 
<br><br>
I called her every afternoon to ask when she would be home, I can still remember her office phone number. This time she only said, <i>I'm afraid it will be a long day.</i>
<br><br>
I would learn the captain had been one of the first to escape, taking off his uniform so he wouldn't be recognized and stumbling into a liferaft in his underwear. He 
clutched at the rescuers and never mentioned the hundreds he had left inside. There had been confusion on the bridge, a sharp turn had left the ship listing, but the 
intercom was broken. They couldn't speak to the people on board, so they played an automated message, the alarm sounded and said simply, 
<i>stay where you are.</i>
<br><br>
My mother spoke softly, <i>I cannot leave, they're telling me to stay.</i> I imagined the walls beginning to tilt, her windows turning dark with the swirling water. Everything 
going horizontal.  
<i>It must be an organized evacuation, </i>she said, <i>they're getting someone else first, then they'll come for me.</i>
<br><br>
The news began to report a rescue was underway, they made meeting points where we were supposed to reach our loved ones. Paper was stapled to the wall with lists of 
those who had been found, yet my mother had stopped picking up. 
<br><br>
People got on stage and assured us everything was fine, that everyone would return, but above their heads I could no longer see the outline of steel walls, the ship 
had fallen beneath the clouds. 
<br><br>
When I went back the street was blocked off, but I knew another way. The ducks had gone now, the oil colored water still and lifeless. I sat and waited for 
something to appear from the fog, but the bank was silent. 
<br><br>
The captain was fired and tried, a new one was hired, work began on a new project downtown, to replace the old one. Soon, the sound of rolling metal returned, 
until we hardly noticed it anymore. 
<br><br>
I would still call my mother's office phone in the evenings, she would pick up sometimes, though her voice was garbled and hard to hear. 
<br><br>
<i>When will you be back?</i> I asked. 
<br><br>
<i>Soon.</i> she said, <i>They just need me here a bit longer.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Haven't you already done enough for them?</i> It was getting harder to not be angry with her. I had stopped going into the city completely. 
<br><br>
<i>Oh Hunter, </i>she spoke so sadly, <i>I would love to watch the ducks with you, but I need to stay.</i>
<br><br>
<i>But these people don't care about you.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Yes, I know. </i> <i>But I care about you.</i>
<br><br>
I thought of her sitting in the dark, as the room had turned completely around and now faced downwards, waiting for the voice to change, to instead say, 
<i>It's time to go home.</i>
