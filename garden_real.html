        Coeur d'Alene sounds nice but it's actually this lake town in Idaho. And it is nice, if you're the sort of person who lives there. 
        <br><br>
        I was staying there for a running camp one summer with my friend Keely. She was small-conservative-town pretty, which actually is the prettiest that 
        anyone can be, and she had this strange childishness - also these wide-set brown eyes,  
        and was very curious.
        <br><br>
        She came to me in the morning and said, I had another dream about Max, 
        <br><br>
        I loved this, and what was he doing? 
        <br><br>
        We had this very passionate sex, she said, it's funny right? That I keep having sex dreams about him? And you're really okay with people dating your partner? 
        You wouldn't get jealous?
        <br><br>
        No, I wouldn't mind, I said, knowing that Max would never go for Keely anyway, it was that childishness, that she always seemed surprised, and you could tell she 
        was always weighing her conservative upbringing against her geniune interest in other people, 
        <br><br>
        Keely's mom took us on the speedboat one morning. The entire bottom of the boat was blue glitter, it sparkled more than the water, 
        Keely and I sat up in the bow where her mom couldn't hear us over the engine, but we could hear her as she shouted out how much the different houses cost. 
        <br><br>
        Keely's two cousins were also runners in Idaho, and were currently filing a lawsuit against a trans girl running on the Montana team, they were arguing that no team 
        in our conference should allow trans women to join, because at some races they would have to run with them. 
        <br><br>
        Sometimes I talked with Keely about this, it's pretty crazy right? What your cousins are doing? 
        <br><br>
        Yeah, they just do their own thing, I don't get involved, she'd say, 
        <br><br>
        But you see them at like family events and stuff right? And what do you guys talk about? 
        <br><br>
        I was probing only to make her have to lie, I already knew she would agree with them the second I left, the same way she would always agree with me, never saying anything 
        one way or the other but nodding, and smiling, 
        <br><br>
        The speedboat went by the most expensive house on the lake, 30 million, her mom shouted, it was a mass of dark wood, 
        <br><br>
        It didn't take long before I wished I was off the boat, that I could be in the cold water alone, 
        <br><br>
When you no longer feel hungry, how do you know when to eat? 
<br><br>
You try and follow everyone else's lead, but you don't feel like them anymore. I know that it's time to eat but how much? I could eat forever and 
also not at all, I could keep putting what I know is food in my mouth but my body doesn't respond anymore, how do I tell right from wrong?
<br><br>
Starvation is a hellofadrug, with it, I protect myself. This last week I was becoming preoccupied with windows, falling from windows, jumping from 
windows, how high is this window? Of course I would never act on these thoughts, but when I saw the eulogy post for a trans woman, I only thought 
of windows more. 
<br><br>
And then I ate less and drank coffee more, and entered a world that I know well, the place where I forget things (what am I doing today?) and 
don't remember people's faces, and open the words up and say them and write them, because I can't think far enough ahead to stop them. And I stopped thinking 
about windows, and stayed pressed to the ground, and asleep, and falling didn't interest me anymore. 
<br><br>
Not eating solidifies the barrier between yourself and the world, nothing penetrates you, you let nothing in. This isn't some Freudian bullshit, this is 
true. Although no substance is impermeable, so many things still enter my body. And many things reside in my body, and continue to react long after the 
stimulus has stopped. 

        <br><br>
It's like the old dairy with the cow statue on the side of the highway. 'Kent Valley' my mom would say, as the car 
sped over the bridge, I remember what we talked about sometimes, on grey mornings above the soggy remains of Kent Valley which will always belong to me and 
Enumclaw and Isaac Brock and Kurt Cobain and everyone who watched birds fold out like polyps from the trees. Those mornings on the way to my grandparents 
you were really taking me somewhere else, because everything I write is only what I saw from the backseat car window. 
<br><br>
<i>Being in love is like the heat in Las Vegas, I hate it</i>
<br><br>
I took a nothing job, a job to help me feel nothing. During the day I roll silverware, then place it in a wicker basket. Then the silverware is taken to the 
tables, and other silverware is cleaned in the washer and brought to me, and I roll it in a small napkin and return it to the basket. I try and speak 
as little as I can, and keep my mind on the order of the fork over the knife, the triangle roll of the napkin, I make the edges very crisp now, with all my 
practice.  
<br><br>
This is my favorite job I've ever had, because while so little is happening I can really find a lot to think about. 

        Intimacy Cryptogram
        <br><br>
        Intimacy like my great aunt's burial (rural Alaska, next to her sled dogs) 
        Intimacy is a clueless word 
        Why do only kids try and write in code, 
        I'd like to get a cryptogram from you. 
        <br><br>
        We're running out of Helium 
        your birthday without a ruby heart
        or it will hang limp 
        with only our own breath now. 
        <br><br>
        Intimacy smells like an apple orchard 
        and like smell, 
        is difficult to give. 
        Perhaps I only lost what you gave me.  
        <br><br>
        
        
        I wish I could start with the sound of the chipmunk who lives in the pines in Western Washington. But I'm afraid to make sounds that aren't words. 
        So you'll just have to imagine his call, which sounds more like a bird, but not like a nightingale.

        "Moving My Joke Body Through The Cold November Night"
                                            
        Trapped and angry, awake before it's even late 
        moving in black coats
        every thing is closed on Sunday
        leaving us all 
        looking over the edges.
        
        Night used to drive me 
        to the porch where the streetlight stood 
        still never could  
        forgo watching the telephone wire 
        still moving towards
        understanding without the words
        I must ask 
        When you will stop 
        When will I stop
        When will I have seen (said) it all enough.  
         
        But here I am still  
        searching the November night
        past front walks and sun rooms 
        past car dealerships 
        It's a maze! these roads to nothing 
        Keeping me stuck in motion.

<b>Small Black Notebook</b>
<br><i>Oceans for Zoe, 2020</i>
<br><br>
Grey-green sea wraps around our small shell, floating here in the kelp weeds, forgotten in the rough landscape that picks and tears 
at itself in the blasting surf. 
<br>I wake with you early, we work until late,
<br>the sea meets us at every moment
<br>crashing otherworldly tones and 
<br>drum beats through the hours 
<br>day in, day out,
<br>One morning we see blue rocks 
<br>shaking through the water
<br>You say they are whales
<br>You begin to paint them. 
<br>One night we walked farther than we ever had 
<br>as the moon shown full 
<br>you look at the sea and feel its low calm 
<br>but not my sweeping peace
<br>we are different that way. 
<br><br>
Rocking against the coast
<br>the ocean whips its foam 
<br>and I rock with it, as though 
<br>you, yourself are shaking me.

<b>Small Black Notebook</b>
<br><i>Portland, 2020</i>
<br><br>
Let the city move me—give in to the core belief 
<br>challenge it in the setting dusk 
<br>as I drive slowly through 
<br>dark streets, the heat suffering,
<br>beaming down and turning the days 
<br>in ways we have never felt. 
<br>I'm driving slower than the other cars 
<br>I'm trying to pick it all apart 
<br>Separate the feeling of suffering from that of freedom
<br>the closest to the dirty ground are the most in control 
<br>they are themselves and I 
<br>appear to be a 'stand in' 
<br>My core belief is that we are all meaningless
<br>and this cannot be disproved 
<br>but sparks of meaning do creep in 
<br>they can't all be felt by everyone 
<br>or everyone would drive slow at sunset
<br>I'm no different, but my sensations are. 
<br>Later in the day, the sun begins 
<br>pressing down on me again, it's peaceful 
<br>where I am right now, 
<br>quiet, with a warm breeze.

<b>Small Black Notebook</b><br>
<i>Train Yard, August 8</i>
<br><br>
I could work long hours at the train yard. 
<br>When the sun went down I'd crawl over the busted up metal 
<br>and stretch my mechanical bite into crushed up rust and glass. 
<br>When I chewed and spat it out the train yard would be bubbling 
<br>with the screeching steel and it would carry alarms and florescence into the city
<br>sweeping sonar in the night air. 
<br>Some days the wind would pick up, 
<br>pulling the dirty trees that circled the yard. 
<br>In their shimmering leaves I'd see something else 
<br>reflected in the yellowed pane 
<br>ancient and human 
<br>I'd watch it like a spector 
<br>We'd all watch it sometimes, especially, 
<br>when there was no moon, and only our yellow lights 
<br>sending tendrils into the brush. 
<br>Some days I would watch the big plastic clock above my desk
<br>big plastic hands that seem so different from the time, 
<br>artificial, stiff night 
<br>big, plastic face glowing on the wall, 
<br>Saying to wake up.

<i>Rainbow Bridge</i>

It's May in another time, one we never thought we would be around for. 
<br>Time moves in ripples and I know my daughter 
<br>will write in a notebook much like this one. 
<br>The way I see things now is the soup of everyone before me, 
<br>the things they did in this same May day. 
<br>I imagine the sun sending brown sheets of dusk over the mountains. 
<br>there is something so soothing in it's rust-red color
<br>I think back to a time I do not believe I have ever seen 
<br>There are children there, and bunk beds, a fleeting moment from a dream 
<br>resurfacing when the light is exactly right, on some May days.

        Things That Mean Nothing: 
        <br>that a single pink PEZ is abandoned on floor of the train 
        <br>that someone had to catch me by my backpack 
        <br>because I tripped when the train started     
        <br>that someone else showed everyone photos of his grandkid 
        <br>that it's my favorite time of day and I didn't tell anyone  
<br><br>
        A Few More Things That Mean Nothing:
       <br> that I feel like a boy sometimes when I see myself in store windows  
       <br> that ants build mounds to live in when they could also just live alone 
       <br> that someone else is probably thinking this same word right now  
<br><br>
        Even More Things That I Know Carry No Meaning:
       <br> that dad used to take me to the United Rentals parking lot
      <br>  at this time of day, after martial arts   
       <br> I went to sit in a parking lot off 82nd last year 
       <br> just to watch the neighbor man smoke on his balcony 
       <br> I used to deliver take-out to people when I had nothing to do 
       <br> I sometimes delivered to the same address twice 
       <br> I've never made an interactive community-based art installation 
       <br> I lose my grasp sometimes 
<br><br>
        The Most Important Things That Mean Nothing:
       <br> that living sometimes reminds me of the drive down to Seattle 
      <br>  for my annual piano recital
       <br> that nobody is looking at me 
       <br> that I actually probably know why ants live in mounds

                        <br>Drown in cold voltaic seas
                        <br>Let me see the night collapse 
                        <br>and crash with you on concrete
                        <br>
                        <br>I'd be anything you need
                        <br>Brand the stamp right into me 
                        <br>Can't you see I'm sideways?
                        <br>take me any way you please
                        <br>Didn't you see I'm hovering? 
                        <br>Going would have came so easy
                        <br>
                        <br>I know I left myself behind 
                        <br>Why'd you have to say something? 
                        <br>I know I didn't make the train
                        <br>but I wanted to so badly 
                        <br>Going would have came so easy
                        <br>
                        <br>All you had to do was take me
                        <br> 
                        <br>What made you think I wasn't worthy?

        <br>We've only just met 
        <br>suddenly you are hearing me 
        <br>we stay in the lines 
        <br>I use my dowsing rod, prodding for warm water
        <br>
        <br>'yes, yes' my vocal tics 
        <br>a dripping bathroom faucet 
        <br>I'm pursing my lip, left eye blinking twice too many 
        <br>like a shutter in the wind
        <br>
        <br>imagine if you reveled in my nervousness
        <br>kissed me and said 'you're unpalatable'
        <br>screamed when I told you what I do for work
        <br>and throttled us both in sweaty arms
        <br>
        <br>please believe I wasn't always this way
        <br>I've only newly forgotten
        <br>what we say to each other 
        <br>
        <br>I remember when I knew what to do
        <br>talking like finding strawberries in the garden 
        <br>talking like small town neighbors 
        <br>a gooey drawl, molasses 
        <br>
        <br>I wish we spoke in that dialect 
        <br>that when you saw my eye flicker
        <br>you thought of your mother 
        <br>flustered in line at the grocery store.

        <i>Bar Night</i> <br> 
        <br>Walking red through the desert, 
        <br>feeling so human,
        <br>dirty snake boots, kicking and screaming, 
        <br>bawling home from the bar, 
        <br>sick in the head, greasy thoughts stuck, 
        <br>slimy in the ears, sucker in the moonlight, 
        <br>hollow in the sand, on and on and on, 
        <br>smirking at the bouncer, who are you anymore?
        <br>Snake bites tearing skin from skin, infection spreading, 
        <br>rocks and bits of everything, strewn over 
        <br>these mountains (step by step) 
        <br>melting, boiling, recombining, 
        <br>but somehow staying - in the rhythm of it all.
