 <i>The powerlines between our houses</i>
<br>
<br>I never knew you went there too
<br>circled the hum of the wires
<br>to the place beneath the lines 
<br>where the sky forms it's own current. 
<br><br>
What did you think of? When you'd leave 
<br>the yard beyond the trailer  
<br>to slip beneath a wet shadow
<br>as though it were a dream 
<br>did I only imagine the day we walked the tracks
<br>found a pit lined with quartz 
<br>sparkling so that it dissappeared 
<br>every day after,
<br><br>
Until the side of that road is where we found 
<br>didn't need to keep driving 
<br>that at some point we could turn to each other 
<br><br>
and through your mouth I could return 
<br>to that strange meadow
<br>wind-torn and thoughtless 
 You call me many names now, not only Hunter but also Melody, Sharon, 
    <br>I can't help but feel your mind works even more like mine now, 
    <br>hazy and always getting on the wrong train.  

 <i>Where does it get me?</i>
<br><br>
It got me to your kitchen this morning 
<br>before dawn 
<br>but not comfortable, somehow 
<br>after all these years 
<br><br>
It got me to my father's vehicle 
<br>looking at fields of rain and 
<br>speaking suddenly 
<br><br>
It got me to a strange quiet zone 
<br>outside of your arms but circling 
<br>the person I know best in this world  
 <div style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%; margin-bottom: 3%">
    Stars fall

     My nutritionist was assigned to me by my trainer when I was 19, 
and I have never stopped seeing her. She's helped me the most in my life of any person other than M and my parents. 
Every two weeks we meet and she asks me how I've been eating, we think of different meals, but mostly we talk about 
why it's important that I eat, and she helps me with my inner dialogue. You would think after four years I would know all the dialogue, but I still learn 
more from her every session, and a lot of my dialogue is just wanting to get better for her.  
<br><br>
Sometimes when we meet I don't know what to say. <i>Things are about the same as the last time, I'm doing pretty well but I mess up sometimes, I 
    give myself a pass when I shouldn't. I have a hard time accepting that I just have to do this every day for the rest of my life, like if I'm doing 
    pretty well for a few days, I let myself restrict. 
</i>
<br><br>
I always think about our sessions before, thinking about how I should phrase that I'm sort of doing what we agreed on last time, and sort of not. I know she 
knows all of my phrasing, 
<br><br>
<i>That's in line with the pattern that we've been seeing, you always say, I've eaten pretty good this week, but last week... </i>
<br><br>
Before this session I wondered when it would end, when I would figure it out. When I would really try.
<br><br>
I feel like I'm always waiting, <i>maybe it's because of the gender disphoria, I just need to fix that and everything will get easier...or it's just 
    because I'm sad right now.
</i> 
<br><br>
But it's mostly because I keep myself here, something asks me to stay back, don't commit to being completely healthy, because then what? Who are you then?  -->

        <i>Lab Work</i>
        <br><br>
        I start my day trying to rename 60,000 DNA files through various means, to stay occupied I've been listening to a 13 hour lecture series going through each chapter of 
        James Joyce's Ulysses, 
        <br><br>
        I open up the files and scroll through strings of A, T, G, Cs in tiny colored squares,
        letters create words which create sentences which create meaning, I think, but that 
        metaphor doesn't really make sense because so much of DNA is meaningless, but then again, 
        <br><br>
        I break for lunch and eat my REWE sushi on the curb outside the museum, 
        my coworkers invite me to lunch sometimes but they've been pissing me off ever since Vivian started dating the vaguely-hot visiting French scientist. I don't actually 
        mind that he chose her, I actually found his big eyes kind of off-putting, but I resent that love is so simple and easy for them, and that they build it in the 
        only room where we can work and not have to wear lab coats. This morning I listened to them play-fight because he skipped forward in a song to see how it ended, 
        <br><br>
        You can't do that! Why can't I? You wouldn't skip to the end of a book to see how it ends. It's not the same. <bR><br>
        I think of the futility of language, 
        <br><br>
        I'm in the diversity lab sorting flies when my coworker who reminds me of my little brother comes in, he looks expectantly from the doorway and I pause 
        the discussion of the chapter where Bloom goes to check if the goddesses in the sculpture garden have anuses, 
        <br><br>
        'Hunter, what do you think it would look like for you to be happy in your life?' <br><br>
        'What?' <br><br>
        'the fridge isn't working right' 
        <br><br>
        I tell him to just use the fridge next to it and go back to tweezing through my soup of flies, in time the flies just look like little beads and I forget that 
        they were once alive, 
        <br><br>
        I think of physicality, of touching an object creating another physical object within the mind,  -->
        
<br><br>        
        I meant to call my mom-mom to wish her a happy birthday last week but I kept putting it off, but she had a stroke before I could call and 
        my dad tells me she has aphasia, i.e. she can no longer speak because she can't find the words anymore, 
        <br><br>
        We could have talked about her birthday party, she telling me about the food and the cake and me asking who she saw, how she is feeling, but now 
        the paths to those words have been erased, she's working to rebuild her words, 'what is your name?', 'what would you like?' but her words have changed, 
        fracturing and sounding strange now, 
        <br><br>
        Our words allow us to sense each other, language like a chemical is picked up by the other, is felt like touching leaves branching from a tree, the 
        components of language make the meaning, we understand the other through sight, sound, and through the order of words, which create feeling individually 
        (one taste, the yell of 'fire' making us jump back from a hot stove) or are strung together to create feelings which layer and mix like a smell, letting us 
        construct the shape of each other. 
        <br><br>
        Were my mom-mom to learn to speak again, she would enter the world a different shape, for 93 years she has worked to align words so that we would 
        understand her, she has spoken to create herself, but 
        <br><br>

        Coeur d'Alene sounds nice but it's actually this lake town in Idaho. And it is nice, if you're the sort of person who lives there. 
        <br><br>
        I was staying there for a running camp one summer with my friend Keely. She was small-conservative-town pretty, which actually is the prettiest that 
        anyone can be, and she had this strange childishness - also these wide-set brown eyes,  
        and was very curious.
        <br><br>
        She came to me in the morning and said, I had another dream about Max, 
        <br><br>
        I loved this, and what was he doing? 
        <br><br>
        We had this very passionate sex, she said, it's funny right? That I keep having sex dreams about him? And you're really okay with people dating your partner? 
        You wouldn't get jealous?
        <br><br>
        No, I wouldn't mind, I said, knowing that Max would never go for Keely anyway, it was that childishness, that she always seemed surprised, and you could tell she 
        was always weighing her conservative upbringing against her geniune interest in other people, 
        <br><br>
        Keely's mom took us on the speedboat one morning. The entire bottom of the boat was blue glitter, it sparkled more than the water, 
        Keely and I sat up in the bow where her mom couldn't hear us over the engine, but we could hear her as she shouted out how much the different houses cost. 
        <br><br>
        Keely's two cousins were also runners in Idaho, and were currently filing a lawsuit against a trans girl running on the Montana team, they were arguing that no team 
        in our conference should allow trans women to join, because at some races they would have to run with them. 
        <br><br>
        Sometimes I talked with Keely about this, it's pretty crazy right? What your cousins are doing? 
        <br><br>
        Yeah, they just do their own thing, I don't get involved, she'd say, 
        <br><br>
        But you see them at like family events and stuff right? And what do you guys talk about? 
        <br><br>
        I was probing only to make her have to lie, I already knew she would agree with them the second I left, the same way she would always agree with me, never saying anything 
        one way or the other but nodding, and smiling, 
        <br><br>
        The speedboat went by the most expensive house on the lake, 30 million, her mom shouted, it was a mass of dark wood, 
        <br><br>
        It didn't take long before I wished I was off the boat, that I could be in the cold water alone, 
        <br><br
When you no longer feel hungry, how do you know when to eat? 
<br><br>
You try and follow everyone else's lead, but you don't feel like them anymore. I know that it's time to eat but how much? I could eat forever and 
also not at all, I could keep putting what I know is food in my mouth but my body doesn't respond anymore, how do I tell right from wrong?
<br><br>
Starvation is a hellofadrug, with it, I protect myself. This last week I was becoming preoccupied with windows, falling from windows, jumping from 
windows, how high is this window? Of course I would never act on these thoughts, but when I saw the eulogy post for a trans woman, I only thought 
of windows more. 
<br><br>
And then I ate less and drank coffee more, and entered a world that I know well, the place where I forget things (what am I doing today?) and 
don't remember people's faces, and open the words up and say them and write them, because I can't think far enough ahead to stop them. And I stopped thinking 
about windows, and stayed pressed to the ground, and asleep, and falling didn't interest me anymore. 
<br><br>
Not eating solidifies the barrier between yourself and the world, nothing penetrates you, you let nothing in. This isn't some Freudian bullshit, this is 
true. Although no substance is impermeable, so many things still enter my body. And many things reside in my body, and continue to react long after the 
stimulus has stopped. 

        <br><br>
It's like the old dairy with the cow statue on the side of the highway. 'Kent Valley' my mom would say, as the car 
sped over the bridge, I remember what we talked about sometimes, on grey mornings above the soggy remains of Kent Valley which will always belong to me and 
Enumclaw and Isaac Brock and Kurt Cobain and everyone who watched birds fold out like polyps from the trees. Those mornings on the way to my grandparents 
you were really taking me somewhere else, because everything I write is only what I saw from the backseat car window. 
<br><br>
<i>Being in love is like the heat in Las Vegas, I hate it</i>
<br><br>
I took a nothing job, a job to help me feel nothing. During the day I roll silverware, then place it in a wicker basket. Then the silverware is taken to the 
tables, and other silverware is cleaned in the washer and brought to me, and I roll it in a small napkin and return it to the basket. I try and speak 
as little as I can, and keep my mind on the order of the fork over the knife, the triangle roll of the napkin, I make the edges very crisp now, with all my 
practice.  
<br><br>
This is my favorite job I've ever had, because while so little is happening I can really find a lot to think about. 
         Intimacy Cryptogram
        <br><br>
        Intimacy like my great aunt's burial (rural Alaska, next to her sled dogs) 
        Intimacy is a clueless word 
        Why do only kids try and write in code, 
        I'd like to get a cryptogram from you. 
        <br><br>
        We're running out of Helium 
        your birthday without a ruby heart
        or it will hang limp 
        with only our own breath now. 
        <br><br>
        Intimacy smells like an apple orchard 
        and like smell, 
        is difficult to give. 
        Perhaps I only lost what you gave me.  
        <br><br> 
         I wish I could start with the sound of the chipmunk who lives in the pines in Western Washington. But I'm afraid to make sounds that aren't words. 
        So you'll just have to imagine his call, which sounds more like a bird, but not like a nightingale.  
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
On this particular day, something will happen. as is the uncomfortable truth, some days things happen. 
some days things come together (like building a house, you spend each day working so hard for the one 
day a month when everything meets itself and suddenly something has happened (you have a working sink, etc)) 
some days bad things happen, these we do not work towards, or maybe in other ways we do, but some 
days you get the call that your cousin has died, or the challenger has exploded, or 5 people are trapped 
under the atlantic ocean, and something has suddenly changed that you could not have ever predicted when you woke up, 
or ate your breakfast, but now when you look back on the day it seems obvious, somewhere you knew already, 
that today was a day when something would happen. i.e. her hands grasped the vial so perfectly, the fit so correct 
that when she took the syringe and placed the drop on to the dish, she could almost see that something different was 
placed in front of her. she ignored this at the time of course, just moved the dish under the microscope and looked. 
<br><br>
was it immidiate? or did she examine a few plankton first, naming the normal species and then find the one 
of interest? and of course it is one, perhaps more later but a change should begin with one. capturing attention. 
<br><br>
but how can you see a smaller version of yourself? if it is a tiny fractal, why here? a tiny seated woman looking 
under a microscope wouldn't make much sense, unless it was too small to make out details, but still large enough for 
a regular microscope to view? seems more plausible that you would need a cutting edge microscope, i.e. we have just broken 
a barrier of human sight, etc. But you could have a mutation.. a fractal self could mutate to be large enough to be seen, or 
a part of a fractal self. But that's so literal, and requires the fractal self to be with her at all times, a single mini-me 
to each person. which seems untruthful. if she is witnessing a mutation it might be more cool to see her witness 
a cell using a smaller cell for energy, or something more bizarre since then I'll have to research how that actually works.. 
but she could observe a cell displaying an early or new form of life and then separate the cell and later that day the 
cell has asexually (or sexually?) reproduced, suddenly her plate has many such new life cells. 
<bR><br>
that would be good, because then she could perhaps observe the cells becoming more advanced. 
<br><br>
the crux of the story is her inability to convey the discover to the rest of the lab? such as she is dealing with the 
knowledge that she is seeing a fractal of herself coming to life within the dish, but the others in the lab don't see the 
importance? or are they only downplaying it because they are also fractals that have been grown the same way, and perhaps 
they have already seen their smaller tendrils come to life.. but then why wouldn't that be an aspect of society? 
<br><br>
perhaps the growth happens very slowly? because if the fractal world grew quickly it would immidiately be examined 
by scientists more qualified than the intern. 
and why did it happen to be here? in her petri dish? why did it reveal itself to her? <br><br>
    - one could argue it had to be somewhere.. as the universe expands it must at some point become large enough to be 
    seen in a regular microscope.. and that would make sense that it would be in the ocean (but is our universe growing 
    at the same rate? then it would always be the same size in our universe, but perhaps there are many different 
    universes within each other, growing at different rates? but why would that be? )
    <br><br>
    - treating the fractal world a bit more literally because having it be a true universe is kind of stupid and vague, it 
    could represent a story, or a mind. assuming it represents a story then the woman represents me, the author, 
    and the seed that she finds within the dish is the spark of the story that she will write. but then why is the seed a mirror 
    of herself? to say that stories are always just a reflection of our own lives? it's a metaphor for art.. okay.. 
<br><br>
    if the fractal world is her story that she wants to write (as it is literally for me) the fractal world will give her 
    fame, notority as an author, a book tour, peace that she has fullfilled her potential, peace that she is on the path that 
    she is supposed to be on, more ideas, the ability to express herself to others, to be understood. 
<br><br>
    so isn't it ironic (!) that the fractal world would be misunderstood by others, perhaps tearing her away from them? 
    isolating her? (reminiscent of addiction, ED, the percieved results (being loved and accepted because you are 
    funnier and more relaxed when you drink) become actually the cause of your isolation and your inabiilty to 
    recieve these things from others.) her proccupation with the fractal world is driven by her want for these things, she 
    begins to spend more and more time examining it, describing it, discovering more things within the story while her 
    life falls apart around her, she becomes isolated and can no longer relate to those around her, she is no longer living 
    her life, she is consumed with the imagined and perfect story, the reflection of herself that she wants others to see, the 
    ultimate creation/story and the normalicy of her life, simply speaking to others in the grocery store, seeing her partner 
    for a movie and dinner, these things no longer matter compared to the thrill of the creation (description?) of the fractal world. 
<br><br>
    so that's interesting, is she creating the world or describing it? really if it's a story metaphor than she would need 
    to actually be putting a lot of effort into making the world, perhaps the ending? that the fractal world that she is trying to 
    get others to see and understand is of her own making?

        "Moving My Joke Body Through The Cold November Night"
                                            
        Trapped and angry, awake before it's even late 
        moving in black coats
        every thing is closed on Sunday
        leaving us all 
        looking over the edges.
        
        Night used to drive me 
        to the porch where the streetlight stood 
        still never could  
        forgo watching the telephone wire 
        still moving towards
        understanding without the words
        I must ask 
        When you will stop 
        When will I stop
        When will I have seen (said) it all enough.  
         
        But here I am still  
        searching the November night
        past front walks and sun rooms 
        past car dealerships 
        It's a maze! these roads to nothing 
        Keeping me stuck in motion.

<b>Small Black Notebook</b>
<br><i>Oceans for Zoe, 2020</i>
<br><br>
Grey-green sea wraps around our small shell, floating here in the kelp weeds, forgotten in the rough landscape that picks and tears 
at itself in the blasting surf. 
<br>I wake with you early, we work until late,
<br>the sea meets us at every moment
<br>crashing otherworldly tones and 
<br>drum beats through the hours 
<br>day in, day out,
<br>One morning we see blue rocks 
<br>shaking through the water
<br>You say they are whales
<br>You begin to paint them. 
<br>One night we walked farther than we ever had 
<br>as the moon shown full 
<br>you look at the sea and feel its low calm 
<br>but not my sweeping peace
<br>we are different that way. 
<br><br>
Rocking against the coast
<br>the ocean whips its foam 
<br>and I rock with it, as though 
<br>you, yourself are shaking me.

<b>Small Black Notebook</b>
<br><i>Portland, 2020</i>
<br><br>
Let the city move me—give in to the core belief 
<br>challenge it in the setting dusk 
<br>as I drive slowly through 
<br>dark streets, the heat suffering,
<br>beaming down and turning the days 
<br>in ways we have never felt. 
<br>I'm driving slower than the other cars 
<br>I'm trying to pick it all apart 
<br>Separate the feeling of suffering from that of freedom
<br>the closest to the dirty ground are the most in control 
<br>they are themselves and I 
<br>appear to be a 'stand in' 
<br>My core belief is that we are all meaningless
<br>and this cannot be disproved 
<br>but sparks of meaning do creep in 
<br>they can't all be felt by everyone 
<br>or everyone would drive slow at sunset
<br>I'm no different, but my sensations are. 
<br>Later in the day, the sun begins 
<br>pressing down on me again, it's peaceful 
<br>where I am right now, 
<br>quiet, with a warm breeze.

<b>Small Black Notebook</b><br>
<i>Train Yard, August 8</i>
<br><br>
I could work long hours at the train yard. 
<br>When the sun went down I'd crawl over the busted up metal 
<br>and stretch my mechanical bite into crushed up rust and glass. 
<br>When I chewed and spat it out the train yard would be bubbling 
<br>with the screeching steel and it would carry alarms and florescence into the city
<br>sweeping sonar in the night air. 
<br>Some days the wind would pick up, 
<br>pulling the dirty trees that circled the yard. 
<br>In their shimmering leaves I'd see something else 
<br>reflected in the yellowed pane 
<br>ancient and human 
<br>I'd watch it like a spector 
<br>We'd all watch it sometimes, especially, 
<br>when there was no moon, and only our yellow lights 
<br>sending tendrils into the brush. 
<br>Some days I would watch the big plastic clock above my desk
<br>big plastic hands that seem so different from the time, 
<br>artificial, stiff night 
<br>big, plastic face glowing on the wall, 
<br>Saying to wake up.

<i>Rainbow Bridge</i>
<br><br>
It's May in another time, one we never thought we would be around for. 
<br>Time moves in ripples and I know my daughter 
<br>will write in a notebook much like this one. 
<br>The way I see things now is the soup of everyone before me, 
<br>the things they did in this same May day. 
<br>I imagine the sun sending brown sheets of dusk over the mountains. 
<br>there is something so soothing in it's rust-red color
<br>I think back to a time I do not believe I have ever seen 
<br>There are children there, and bunk beds, a fleeting moment from a dream 
<br>resurfacing when the light is exactly right, on some May days.

        <br><i>Things That Mean Nothing: </i>
        <br><br>
        Things That Mean Nothing: 
        <br>that a single pink PEZ is abandoned on floor of the train 
        <br>that someone had to catch me by my backpack 
        <br>because I tripped when the train started     
        <br>that someone else showed everyone photos of his grandkid 
        <br>that it's my favorite time of day and I didn't tell anyone  
<br><br>
        A Few More Things That Mean Nothing:
       <br> that I feel like a boy sometimes when I see myself in store windows  
       <br> that ants build mounds to live in when they could also just live alone 
       <br> that someone else is probably thinking this same word right now  
<br><br>
        Even More Things That I Know Carry No Meaning:
       <br> that dad used to take me to the United Rentals parking lot
      <br>  at this time of day, after martial arts   
       <br> I went to sit in a parking lot off 82nd last year 
       <br> just to watch the neighbor man smoke on his balcony 
       <br> I used to deliver take-out to people when I had nothing to do 
       <br> I sometimes delivered to the same address twice 
       <br> I've never made an interactive community-based art installation 
       <br> I lose my grasp sometimes 
<br><br>
        The Most Important Things That Mean Nothing:
       <br> that living sometimes reminds me of the drive down to Seattle 
      <br>  for my annual piano recital
       <br> that nobody is looking at me 
       <br> that I actually probably know why ants live in mounds
