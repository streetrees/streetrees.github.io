Outside the library, a house stood up on the hillside, it's outside was pink patchwork, it was pulsing to me, as houses do.  
<br><br>
At my high school awards ceremony I wore a white dress. It was long with small flowers and buttons running from the neck to the hem, 
<br><br>
beneath the dress was an unpleasant truth, my skin was only animal skin, but I still walked to the stage and received my awards. 
<br><br>
My father liked to cover the world in gauze, through his frivolous visions, 
<br><br>
the pulsing house, but it isn't really, it's only the light caused by grey clouds. 
<br><br>
In the car, we stopped at the light adjacent to the Muckleshoot Casino and looked up at the moving billboard,
<br><br>
Aces spread out on a green felt table, then a fish hovered in a stream, waiting,
<br><br>
when pushed in the silence of the car ride I tried to finally say,
<br><br>
<i>you have only made me up, your conception of me is imagined.</i>
<br><br>
Under the fluorescent sign he said, 
<br><br><i>
I've always viewed you as a beautiful woman, and I'm not sure if I want that to change...</i>
<br><br>
We lived on a plateau and the sun would set. I went out with my mother to her car one night as she tried to get behind the wheel. 
<br><br>
If only her hands would work, they grasped the leather and she looked out the stationary windshield, as though it were the line of trees that blocked us, 
<br><br>
instead of me only saying, <i>you can't drive away,</i> meaning in her state, but she didn't try again.  
<br><br>
I pulled her by the wrist and leaned against the door of her room, holding the doorknob as she turned it slowly, 
<br><br>
inside the room, my father pretended to be sleeping, fish swam in the stream outside, all the while. 
<br><br>
There were in fact many men in the house. There were in fact many women in the house. 
<br><br>
If it had simply not been our stream but a stream, if it had not been our house but a house made by an animal, 
<br><br>
Would he have noticed the picture of the married woman he had pasted over my body? Would he have realized he had forgotten to ask simply <i>who are you?</i>
<br><br>
Often the craneflies in the attic went by unnoticed. They flew around the light from the TV downstairs, as he flicked through the news channels. 
<br><br>
I went alone to the stream and found frogs, I did not imagine them but instead watched to see what they did. 
<br><br>
I looked down at my body and removed the gauze, <i>I'm not so sure, you're seeing things right.</i>
<br><br>
He saw what he was told to see by his mother. I looked around and believed the stream could someday wash the house away.
