I'm finally ready to talk about it. Or maybe I'm not, but maybe this will all make me ready. All of this feeling it out and 
probing for truth beneath all of the things I think I remember. But know I don't.

I'd like to tell you about the factory. It was one of those places you knew you were going to end up in but you didn't know 
how it was going to all come about. You didn't know what dance of missteps would lead you through that chain link fence. But when I 
looked at the metal door softly lit through the night, the soft touch of the streetlight warming its metal handle, sometimes 
looking a crack ajar, I knew I'd be opening it some day. 

Then I needed a job, I'd needed one for some time, really. The grocery store was cutting my hours, and it wasn't because of 
my issue with sweeping the isles. Actually, Roger didn't even tell me what I'd done. My full-day grey-block on the schedule in the 
coffee room had just been slowly shaved down over the last few months until only a few slivers a week remained. When I asked 
my friend one morning if she'd noticed it she just glanced at the board and pursed her lips. I didn't like her much anyway. 

That night I saw a flyer fluttering in the wind above the aquaduct. I wasn't surprised when I read the bolded letters, 

HELP WANTED
FACTORY WORKER FOR SUGAR PRODUCTION LINE 

I've worked a lot of shitty jobs. The first was at 16, I was hired as a server at the local roller rink. The roller rink was 
also connected to a bowling alley, which was also part of my juristiction as the only server on Monday nights. I'd arrive 
at my shift at quarter-past seven and start the slow creep down the fabric benches, clearing away what 
pizza and chip remnants I could, sliding my un-gloved hand through endless patches of cherry coke residue, 
the stains blending into one mass, one organism, the entire food court encased in a magnetic and repulsive membrane. 

The cook would help me clear tables sometimes, although he would get frustrated quickly and go back to standing 
against the wall in the kitchen, smoking under the small 'window' that had long since lost its pane and was now only a 
hole to the cold night, covered with only a thin strip of celophane or masking tape, depending on the season. When he did 
help me the cook was generally unpleasant, he once asked me if I knew that I was required to wear a hairnet to work. No, 
I said, I did not know that.  

While I found the cook to be a flawed individual, I did enjoy the manager of the roller rink who would come by once every 
few months to fix whatever problems were the most visible to customers. She was a colorful and mysterious presence in the 
building, always arriving without warning and going directly to her small office upstairs, she only spoke to me a handful of times. 
The first was when I was hired, she'd invited me up into the strange, cramped office. Her nails were long and green and she 
anxiously tapped a pen cap on the folding table (plastic) while asking me the cursory 'so this is your first job?' 'yes' and 
'are you comfortable speaking with customers?' I'm still not sure if she asked this because she was trying to mislead me about the 
position or if she genuinely was unaware that the rink had almost no customers on Monday nights. 'Yes, I love people'. A cursory lie 
to a non-question. As the interview went on I could not help but notice the strangeness of the room, the walls were covered with 
photographs of her and her late father. Mr. Leslie was an easily recognizable man, with a reddish, round face and bushy eyebrows that 
moved closer towards convergence through the years. His daughter, pale and strangely featured, her nose rising up to a sharp 
point, appeared gaunt and ghostly next to him. Yet, there they smiled in portrait after portrait, some taken in studios and 
others in exotic destinations. The oversaturated sheen of the pictures made the office feel like a sparsely decorated 
travel agency. 


She'd gotten the whole place from her father when he 
passed, yet
